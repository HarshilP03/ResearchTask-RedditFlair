Reddiquette,[Reddiquette] I'm feeling delusional. Am I mentally sick?,ak3tt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ak3tt5/reddiquette_im_feeling_delusional_am_i_mentally/,"The delusions are telling me that there's a completely different form of reality that I am suppressing. An alternate way of living. And it is saying that it's my current way of living which is delusional instead. To make things clear, I'm referring to illusion by the word delusional. 
I should give you a perspective. I feel I should run away from the current way of life because it is a lot of words and symbols. Like job, future, girlfriend, career, love from other people, wanting to become a writer, wanting to buy latest and most advanced mobile phone and TV etc. I feel like starting from the scratch and rejecting everything world has to offer. I know a few places where even food and living won't be problem. There's therefore this conflict I'm going through therefore."," Buddy it's that phase of life where you gotta sit and revisit some recent decisions that may have led you to this situation, there is nothing more to it unless you let it get to you. Thanks for checking on yourself and talking about it.

Firstly **forgive** yourself if you think you have done something wrong and in case your social environment has led you to this situation then try and **forget** it. 

The forgive and forget part is crucial, after this just spend a day or two like you usually do and see if it still makes you feel delusional. 

Finally if you still feel delusional then the you gotta consult doctor which is for the best. Absolutely nothing wrong with taking care of your mental health, we often seem to ignore it and make it worse. This is called depression.  Yes, go visit a psychiatrist before it turns into full fledged psychosis. Please visit a psychiatrist and talk about this. That's the best way to get a professional opinion on whether there are any underlying issues.

Also remove any taboo that you may have associated with mental sickness. The mind, like the body can also get sick and there is nothing wrong with it. Dude, this is completely normal! I get these thoughts every morning... But things go normal after breakfast, and when I have to take public transport to office! You mean you’re going through adolescence? Let me get this straight.You realised that the world you live in is revolving around a few words and symbols.You feel that the performances are meaningless or Do you feel that the whole  thing is overwhelming?

I think there's more to it than you've presented. In any case, running away is usually a sub-optimal solution.Think critically, or get somebody who is an expert in critical thinking to help you unpack your idea - possibly a counselling psychologist. Fyki , being a sadhu is not a solution . Its a big scam. Just wondering you username Where is such a place? Like an ashram or some such?  What if you change your mind in the future? There will be no going back. I'd suggest being a part of this world while not consuming all of it if you so wish. Just collect enough resources to live comfortably.",2019-01-27 08:31:08
Reddiquette,"[serious] [reddiquette] [askindia] March End woes, questions regarding rent receipt submission and taxation and legalities.",b6uzbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b6uzbt/serious_reddiquette_askindia_march_end_woes/,"Hello r/india! I have been living in a non-metro city for past few years and recently shifted jobs (Company A and B) and houses (House H1 and H2) both.

**Backstory:**

Concerned apartment (and other unknown businesses) is/are owned by a lady ""F"", whose husband ""M"" holds an ""Irrevocable Power of Attorney"" for all things owned/operated/etc by F. Account provided to me to transfer rent every month belongs to daughter ""D"" (no idea if it is joint account). M had sent me his HUF PAN card photo before the agreement was done.

Due to some issues, broker who showed the flat was out of picture during actual registration of agreement - which happened at sub-registrar's office and not online. M was never asked to submit his individual PAN or even present F's PAN.

All rent transfers were always online (IMPS or NEFT) from the my same account to the provided D's account.

**Actual Issue:**

From April 2017 to March 2019, I have been staying at the H1. The rent was initially little less than 14k and then after 11 months, me and my owner mutually agreed to extend the agreement (over a phone call), in which he also proposed an increase in rent of rupees 1000/-. Later, in a next call few days later, he asked me to 'pay rounded amount' as the rent which was exact 15k. I obliged to his terms all the times.

Now, when in January 2018, I had asked him for PAN, he said he'll talk to his lawyer and decide. Later, he declined giving it to me. Because I was not in any taxable slab, CA at company A only showed <1 lacs as rent paid and it was fine. This CA was not fine with M's HUF PAN as owner's PAN.

Coming to January 2019, I was confident owner would not provide PAN but still gave a call and to my surprise he said yes. He kept on prolonging actually giving it to me citing ""TDS would be cut"". I told him he's a Self Employed person, so no one is going to cut TDS from him. He still never gave it. LOL. So even for FY18-19, CA at company A used 8000/- as rent paid every month as I was still out of tax slabs (submitted original agreement copy and bank statement - was never asked to submit rent receipts, and no PAN was submitted here).

End on Jan, I switched jobs. Company B CA did not have a problem with HUF PAN and asked me to submit rent receipts with HUF PAN mentioned. Also, when I explained him the scenario, he asked me to address rent receipts to ""M"" instead of ""F"" as I had previously done.

Rent for H1 has been paid until March 2019, but I shifted to H2 (rent 22k) around mid March and paid equivalent rent there too. H2 has a registered agreement from March 2019 which allowed me to shift mid month because of an emergency.

**Important Note:**

I don't care how M or F move their money around (may be in millions, has political family and is from rural west MH).
All I care is saving my money and not paying his taxes - now that I am taxable. And not legally implicated.

**Questions:**

1. Whose PAN should actually have been provided/asked by me during registration of agreement?
2. Submitting rent receipts for first time: Legal issues for forging M's signature (for actual rent paid as he would never give signature voluntarily)?
3. Given that actual registered agreement period was over after 11 months but I was actually staying there for 13 months more and paying electricity bills and rents (all online) prove I was still a resident at the flat?

Question 3 assumes that I get IT query after owner declares signatures forged, declines I was resident or paid rent for period after agreement.

Thanks to all for your time and help.

TLDR: Verbally extended rental agreement has no PAN as owner/attorney does not wish to provide it. Forging signature on receipts for actual rent paid online every time. Implications?",,2019-03-29 22:41:37

If this is the best we have to offer, I will take it up silently and hope Anurag Kashyap does not notice my deflated penis two inches below, because boy, I am not impressed by your performance."," >  In what world RAW operates like chutiyas

that part was vikram motwane

> In what world, you can have anal sex without noticing your partner' hanging penis and scrotum two inches below

never was it implied that gaitonde had no idea,  just that kukku was hesitant to explicitly show him her dong.

> Kukku was the key to Mumbai underworld but why ?

figuratively bhai, she was gaitonde's infatuation, dialogues like ""tumhe paa liya toh dunia paa li"" dont mean literally

There might be other things to rant about the show, but not kashyap's part. The whole gaitonde story is fascinating, right from the pilot's depiction of gaitonde's ""vitthala vitthala"" chanting brahmin father and disloyal mother, to his gradual rise as an underworld heavyweight, and then his scenes in jail. I liked it , binged the whole season. I honestly think we supporting this will bring change, Netflix might produce more shows and movies with a good cast, scriptwriters and directors.
The background score is great n  gave me chills , some of the scenes. Direction is pretty neat too. Anurag Kashyap is like AAP? Meaning he is being prevented by a narcissistic right wing chutiya from ushering in necessary and popular change that the people have mandated?

Edit: a word itne paise mein itnaich milega boss. >Anurag kashyap is like AAP, promises a lot, but delivery is somewhat disappointing

Haven't seen the show and planning to watch it, so didn't read the rest. But, honestly, which part of Black Friday, Gulaal, Dev D, Yellow Boots, Ugly and Mukkebaaz were disappointing?

Sure, a few misfires here and there such as Bombay Velvet, but, then who doesn't have them? > Anurag kashyap is like AAP, promises a lot but delivery is somewhat disappointing.

I don't check/login to reddit usually but I specially logged in to say this.

At least AAP delivers. If Anurag had been like BJP he'd just keep on promising and blaming the other directors/writers et al. It is Ram Gopal Verma's fault! It is Chetan Bhagat's fault! It is Nehru's fault

P.s. I don't like that you are trivializing the only party that seems to be working against the mafia in Indian businesses. AAP is the future. AAP is the only party that opposed the foreign funding of political parties.

Stop trivializing good people. I too watch movies by Trantino, Ws Andreson and Nlan.  How do you know RAW doesn't operate like chutiyas? And aren't inept like every other government agency? I’ve been expecting these posts bashing the show but not this soon. I guess the show has gotten really popular so soon. Idk what’s “typical Bollywood storyline” about this show. There’s no hero, you know what happened to villain in the first episode and there are no dance sequences (let’s not include that one dance sequence). It’s not a revenge story, there are no unrealistic fights, there was brilliant acting most of the time and there are barely any boring scenes.  >Anurag kashyap is like AAP, promises a lot but delivery is somewhat disappointing.

Do you think the same about Black Friday, Ugly, GOW etc. If yes, I am not sure what Bollywood director satisfies you with his delivery.

>In what world, you can have anal sex without noticing your partner' hanging penis and scrotum two inches below. 

As someone else also said, why do you think Gaitonde doesn't know that? If you think he doesn't know then I guess you are the one who needs to think more.

>Kukku was the key to Mumbai underworld but why?

When Gaitonde arrived in Mumbai he was hanging out with low level criminals and small time thugs who had no idea who Kukoo was. They would only know that she is a hot girl who is with a big mafia. You need to understand that what he thinks about Kukoo is a result of his infatuation and what he might hear from these guys who are more likely to talk like that. It is just a way of thinking which is a result of ones surrounding and his own awareness. He was quite inexperienced and just starting in the criminal world back then.

 I really don't know what know what are you talking about. I dropped Westworld season 2 in  the middle to binge watch this. I honestly thought that I'd give  the pilot a try but ended up watching 5 episodes one after another. Almost everything from the production point of view was great. The plot was really gripping. The direction was obviously amazing. I admit there were a few loopholes and misfires like Saif not knowing how to speak Punjabi properly or some of Radhika's dialogues or the CGI which imo should be forgiven because they probably didn't have too much budget for that. It was one of the best things I've seen on Netflix for a while and I'm not saying that because I want to show support for our local shows. I really found it a lot better than I had expected it to be. With the amount of posts about this show and the superlative praises in the comments, I wouldn't be surprised if Netflix hired social media ""influencers"" to generate word of mouth buzz for their show. They do that for their american shows. [removed] It was an average drama with good acting and great dialogues. I honestly can't understand why so many people are raving about it. The plot and direction were too insipid, predictable and boring.

Edit: i haven't read the book. So how true was the adaptation?",2018-07-09 00:49:35

He kept honking the moment traffic slowed down even a little bit. Was stuck behind me for 10  minutes. He kept honking again and again. Seriously wanted to flip him off. Pointless noise pollution.  Even I hate honking, but there have been so many instances where I have seen motorcyclists, bicyclists etc make sudden left or right turns that I feel the need to honk, just to make them aware I am overtaking, while passing them. Once the signal turns green people will start moving , there is literally no need to start honking when the countdown hits 5.. When honking can widen the road then why not It's an overpopulated dystopia, honk hard or drown in the sound. Sad truth. Not just the honking! Fiddling with the dipper during rush hour as if the cars ahead will suddenly dissolve into thin air is beyond irritating. 

 I always give slight honks when making a turn or overtaking or changing lanes and i don't mid other people doing this, what i do mind though is retards honking in heavy traffic as if that's gonna solve anything especially hate those modified loud horns which people add by themselves.

Reddiquette,[Reddiquette] Rant about quora,7h2uhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7h2uhv/reddiquette_rant_about_quora/,"Let me begin by clearing why I use quora. While reddit is great for asking question on various communities, quora is the only place where I can get unironic answers for my questions related to various exams conducted in India. 


But what is up with these Indian quora users? Do they really think that giving a really long answer would make up for the lack of attention they received from the opposite gender in their school college. What is inhibiting them from giving a straight and concise answer to simple straight forward question. 


Now I know that there are quorans who wave around their degrees from IITs and IIMs, but truth be told, rarely I have seen an IIM grad irl who gives such long and lofty answer to anything. They keep it short and simple. The same cannot be said about IITians. Yes I know you worked hard to get where you are, but you don't have to rub it in on someone who doesn't care about your degree and is just here for clearing something up.

Coming back to the rant, does every answer need to be an essay on your life? Also, if I am asking an insightful/technical question of which I happen to know somethings  I am really interested in what I asked. I don't want the googled textbook definition  that you ripped off from a website to sound smart and I certainly don't need all the background information on the topic. For example, I recently came across a question asking if Arnab Goswami is a liberal or conservative. Now this randi quoran gave a 200 word explanation on what it means to be a liberal and a conservative. And then went on to the function of the government. In the final sentence was his answer. THE  ANSWER NEEDED WAS JUST ONE SENTENCE and he wrote 500 word essay. 


Also, the whole of quora is the r/askreddit sub. All the question that get answered are the questions which have nothing insightful.  I remember asking a question about the Rakhine situation, and ended up getting answers from an extremely xenophobic dude, who ranted how all bangladeshis should be killed who come to India. I mean dude, can you even read. I just asked why Myanmar refused to accept Rohingya as it's residents.


Also, what is up with these teenagers giving out life lessons?  They are 18 ffs. They have barely even experienced it. 

Tl:dr; Rants of a madman on quora users. I know there are subreddits such as r/indianpeoplequora and r/rant , however I chose this subreddit since the people at r/rant won't get what I am on about and it isn't exacty r/indianpeoplequora material."," Just use it for your competitive exam related queries and don't use it for anything else. I have facebook just to send some messages or attachments incase whatsapp does not work, don't use it otherwise. 

Edit: Adding to what I said, no site is 100% useful, reddit has lots of shit floating around (in fact I would say majority of reddit is absolute shithole) but we only visit the good parts. Its true for most things in life, use the parts which are useful to you, don't use the rest.  Here's how I use quora, if I have a question I google it. If a quora link comes up as a search result then read answers otherwise don't go to quora.  Mate you have to block like, every single Indian author on Quora along with “India” topic. This is the only way to reduce shit from coming up on your news feed. It took me few hours but it was worth the effort.  on quora, you will notice young people are giving life lessons, advices, experiences.......(which you normally expect from elders)

I' be like ""itna experience laatein kahaan se yeh bachhe""
 Not to mention when indian sapios try to write sarcastic answers when somebody    asks questions about how they are in depression and feeling suicidal. Ah. Nice rant. Let me tell you a story of when I was in IIT Kharagpur 2 years back. ..... r/indianpeoplequora [deleted] a girl once told me that she is cheif on some topic on quora . i have stoppedtalking to her since The psyche of Indians is very limited and this is the fault of our education. I left Quora because of these sapiosexual types increasing in number. I get that you can be sometimes proud of your college or whatever, but to make it as an identity throughout your life is limiting yourself as getting into IITs becomes your sole highest achievement of your life.

This is exactly reflected in Quora and other sites.

Although, I don't want to stereotype every Quora Indian. There are some people who have lived their substantial adult working life in the USA or some other country and still give biased answers against Muslims or minorities of the country they live in etc. This is what is really disheartening. 1.) Qualifications are the only thing most Indians can boast about to compensate for small penis/ovaries or a lack of a non-curated life brought to you by their parents. 

2.) Check the answer, if it has too many links. Then it's just someone trying to get the tiny link juice their SEO achieves from Quora. If that's the case Harsh Agarwal's ShoutMeLoud army at work.
 I found it similar to what you describe however it takes time to correct your feed.

1. Downvote or report every answer you dont think is good enough. Give reasons for reporting. I found out after a few days of downvoting my content changed dramatically.
Indians overtake your feed if you dont downvote or mute them.

2. Follow different authors or accounts. Most Indian authors write similar and it gets boring very quickly.

3. Its changing to a author-centric site as someone mentioned to a collection of people's experiences. If you like reading about them give it a try. I recently followed a guy who used to work in Russian propoganda ministry. Its fascinating to see his writing.

Quora is now mostly a site for people to share their experiences. Factual answers pop up very less. If you like such content, give it a try. Horny saapio virgins trying hard to get into someone's pants. [deleted] Use the mute button liberally.  Isn't your rant a long essay? ",2017-12-03 03:48:53

After a lot of submission removals for flair abuse, we have merged the ''Entertainment'' and ''Non-political'' flairs to ""Casual"" flair. It will help users to keep it a bit simple when choosing the correct flair. Please use the flair 'Casual' for all links and posts that are of a non-political nature, including images, memes, entertainment related posts and others which do not fall under the other categories.

[NP] tag in the title will automatically assign the new ""Casual"" flair as well. If you have any questions please feel free to post.
"," ""Casual"" would look bad for issues with serious matter. just saying Hmm... so... a natural-disaster news will automatically become casual? NO MORE FLAIRS! Why not just stop removing submissions for flair abuse for those two flairs? ""Casual"" isn't any kind of tag. A tag is supposed to be specific, not vague/ generic. Think about the utility of such a tag - why would I ever want to filter r/india for ""casual"" tagged posts? I wouldn't know what outcome to expect.   

Come up with better (highly-specific and filtering-relevant) tags please; take suggestions from members.  it also needs an education/exam related flair or something https://i.imgur.com/XI6gzNH.jpg

Reddiquette,[Np] Reddiquette. You Should Know : The largest combined arms operation after WW2 that resulted in the largest number of prisoners gained after WW2. India's brilliant victory in the 1971 war.,2dbsis,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2dbsis/np_reddiquette_you_should_know_the_largest/,"The Indian victory against Pakistan in 1971 was one of the greatest examples of operational art and the largest combined arms operation after World War 2. It was a masterpiece of Political objective, Strategic vision, operational planning and tactical execution.


It is important to understand why it was seen as such a great victory. Warfare is usually divided into Positional attrition warfare (think World War 1, Iran-Iraq war or even the India-China war / India-Pakistan war of 1965) or maneuver driven situational warfare. The concept of maneuver warfare was propounded (at around the same time) by various European warfare experts, B.H.Liddel Hart (England) and Mikail Tucahavesky (shot dead by Stalin, and one of THE finest military minds the world has ever seen) was it’s greatest exponent. His theory was, 


Attack on a broad front > use air superiority and arty to make holes in the enemy line > Use this penetration to feed in highly mobile troops who would use maneuver to keep the enemy off balance. The Positional warfare suggests that you can win a war only by crushing the enemies main point of defense (mostly frontally – the British were a firm believer in this theory) while indirect / maneuver warfare suggests that you avoid the strong points, and hit the vulnerable rear of the enemy, keep him off balance, deny him his CCI structure and win the war by using terrain and encirclement (read up on Cannae or Kharkov / Smolensk for examples of encirclement warfare) .


India which had favoured the first theory in all it’s wars till then used the second theory to great effect.


**The Planning:**


In March 1971, Indira Gandhi came back to power with a resounding mandate, and was faced with an immediate crisis! The Bangladeshi refugee problem. A genocide in East Pakistan (estimated deaths vary from 3 million to 4 million) was pushing a massive amount of refugees into India. Her cabinet (especially Defence minister Jagjivan Ram) favoured immediate invasion to settle this crisis and to discuss this, she summoned the CoAS – Sam ‘Bahadur’ Manekshaw. In a very interesting and stormy meeting, she told him to prepare for an invasion of East Pakistan.  Sam Bahadur point blank refused to entertain this and offered to resign straight away. Indira who was used to getting her way, did not like this resistance but asked her advisors to leave the room and had Manekshaw speak his mind freely. He laid down three reasons why he preferred an invasion in the closing months of the year. In this he was going against both Jagjivan Ram and Indira Gandhi  and he was aware of this, but he refused to be a party to a botched up invasion.


•	The Passes with China would be closed because of snow, making it difficult for the Chinese to intervene. In June (when Indira was asking him to invade) the passes would be clear and would need a diversion of efforts to defend these.

•	Monsoon (in this he was proven very right) and the resulting quagmire. The Russian word for it was called “Raptistuta” and means a sea of mud! Mud is the worst enemy for movement (even hard snow can be managed) as it stalls movement to a very low speed. Monsoon would also mean rivers would be in spate so bridging & fording them would be eminently more challenging. August that year saw the worst tropical storm on record till date. It inundated whole parts of Bangladesh and killed half a million Bangladeshi’s.

•	The last was building up a strong and valid cassus belli (cause for war). If India was seen as the aggressor, sanctions would cripple an already crippled economy. It needed to make a case for itself. In the mean time it could use the Bangladeshi govt in exile (based in Calcutta) and the newly created Mutki Bahini to drum up support for itself.

Indira Gandhi agreed to his conditions and set about on a whirlwind tour of diplomacy. She went to Moscow, US, UK & France. She told the governments there that the situation was untenable, but Pakistan was a strong member of the SEATO and CENTO so the western democracies (in a blatant case of hypocrisy) stood by idly while a massive genocide was being perpetrated. Only the USSR recognized the problem, and shipped arms & ammunitions to India to build up her stockpile. India also signed a 20 year treaty of friendship and mutual assistance (this was to prevent any actions by the NATO / US / China)


Mankeshaw then went to work. He created a JIC (IB+RAW+Military intelligence) and a Joint Planning Command (India did not and still does not have a Combined Chief of Staffs like other nations do) to bring the civilians, army, navy and airforce together in the planning. Overall command was given to Lt Gen J.S.Arora who was CiC of the Eastern Command.


**Order Of Battle**


The OOB was as follows, Eastern Command > 3 Army Corps (2nd, 33rd and 4th) > 5 Infantry divisions + 2 Mountain that were on defensive mode. Attached to the infantry divs we had the equivalent of 1 armored division (broken up into regiments). 
Pakistan had roughly 3 Infantry divs and 2 divisions worth of paramilitary and a brigade of armour.


The odds were roughly 2:1 favouring India (conventionally 4:1 was recommended, 3:1 was the bare minimum). In the air India had total supremacy in the east(which was vital) and marginal superiority in the west.


The Mukti Bahini had roughly 60,000 numbers of irregulars. They played the exact same role the French partisans played in WW2 after Normandy. During the war, the Mukti Bahini contributed to the speed of advance of the Indians by providing ready labor and intelligence on the deployment of Pakistani forces. The MB sabotaged Pakistani lines of communication, they struck at weak points (in the rear) with brigade sized forces and caused the Pakistani defence to spread itself thin.


**The Indian Plan**

It was multi layered in it’s approach. Attack in depth to force the Pakistanis to thin themselves out, Cutoff river crossings (to prevent reinforcements and retreat from reaching the Pakistani troops) and finally capture the two key ports in Bangladesh. 

There was one major element of genius provided by J.S.Arora. He changed the Schwerpunkt from the logical south to the more difficult east. The South had it’s base in Bengal, had access to major railway lines and depots and Lt Gen Niazi (Pakistani commander) anticipated the main focus (Schwerpunkt) to be in this sector and aligned his defences accordingly. The East had everything going against it. The main base was inn Tripura, supply / logistics chains had immense difficulties but it was also the closest route to Dhaka. 

J.S Arora allocated the strongest force to the East and the weakest force to the South (the exact opposite of the Pakistani defensive alignment). This has it’s roots in classical warfare including WW2 and the battle of Cannae (which was positional warfare for it’s time). Operation Barbarossa focused it’s Schwerpunkt in the Centre and North while Stavka (Soviet high command aka Stalin) anticipated the key thrust in the South. The German approach to indirect warfare surprised the Russians and caused them a massive loss in men, space and equipment.


**The Pakistani Plan**

Counter offensive in the West and a tiered defense in the East using river lines and cities as strong points (very similar in concept to the Russian defense in WW2 – use river lines and force attritional warfare on the invader. Retreat to city holdfasts and engage troops in urban warfare. Hold out and delay the offensive till such time the UN forced a cease fire (like it had done in the Israeli wars). 

In Bangladesh, Niazi proposed retreating to just outside Dhaka and holding a region around Dhaka (using river lines and Dhaka as a central pivot). The Pakistani establishment rejected this. Once again we have parallels in World War 2. Poland had the option to withdraw it’s forces to the Vistula line, use Warsaw as a pivot and defend a limited area, both these sound ideas were rejected because…”Nationalism”! Not one inch of land would be surrendered etc etc. Niazi went for (as the Indian side had hoped) the WW2 Russian strategy of defending some fortified towns (or as Hitler called them – Festungs) and river lines (bridges). 

The idea was to cut down on the Indian freedom of movement by forcing them to engage in urban warfare. They did make a fatal flaw in their planning. They assumed that India would fight 10 different “Stalingrads”, and never reach Dhaka so they never allocated troops to defend Dhaka (the same mistake Hitler made in WW2 with respect to the defence of Berlin)


**The War**

•	3rd December, Operation Chingis goes in. Pakistan launches a preemptive strike on Indian airfields (in the West). The IAF fights a holding campaign before launching a massive bombardment operation the next morning. In the East, elements of 33 Corps go into action, their objective is to take a vital railway junction. Hilli however was one of the first echelons of Pakistan’s defenses and was very well prepared and supplied. The battle quickly became a battle of attritional warfare, however 340 Brigade spotted an opening in the flank and in a very German Blitzkrieg type of operation, formed combat groups (on the spot) of tanks and infantry and exploited the gap, and these combat groups raced to the river lines that Pakistan had intended to use as defensive strongpoints. Faced with Indians in the rear and forward of them, the resistance quickly collapsed.


•	In the South, using maneuver warfare (as against to positional warfare used by 33 Corp) 2 Corps makes rapid progress, 2 Corps launches a pincer attack using two infantry divisions to envelop Pakistani defences. They keep pushing on towards their target without giving the defenders time to rest and redraw their defensive lines. 2 Corps used the classic maneuver tactics used by Germany in WW2, Israel in the Sinai. They ignored strong points while rushing the rear of the enemy lines (the OMG of Russian doctrine came into play). The infantry pushed on into Pakistani frontline positions who attempted to withdraw to prepared lines only to find them occupied by Indian troops. Defense spectacularly collapsed in this sector. 

•	In the East, 4 Corps (the largest Indian grouping with 3 divisions) and a bold leader pretty much repeated what 2 Corps did. The CO (Lt Gen Sagat Singh) used the Russian concept of Maskirovka and set up a feint attack towards Chittagong, this drew Pakistani defenders (already facing 3:1 odds) to Chittagong weakening their centre. Here we come across a massive feat of arms – Airlifting of 2 entire combat equipped brigades. Rather than contest the Meghna river bridges, Singh sidestepped the exceedingly strong Pakistani defences by getting 2 brigades airlifted and dropped across the river (right into Pakistani lines). The eastern sector was decided as the Schwerpunkt (the focus point of the offensive) and it showed. The Indian troops rapidly outflanked prepared Pakistani positions, artillery was used to bombard these pockets into submission, the IAF flew CAS (Combat Air Support) / Interdiction missions all of which freed the infantry and armour to keep moving. This was classic Blitzkrieg minus only the Stuka sirens. 


The Pakistani forces were in headlong retreat towards Dhaka and this posed a big problem. If they gained the Dhaka region, they could organize a very stubborn defense which would cost 1000’s of Indian lives to capture. To prevent this, 2 Para was dropped BEHIND enemy lines into the region of Tangail. They were very less in number, and if the Pakistanis had grouped up and attempted to fight their way through, 4 Para could have been decimated, but thanks to the Indian Blitzkrieg tactic, the Pakistani C&C set up was decimated and they could not mount a cohesive response. After the drop, the demoralization (and destruction) of organized resistance was complete.


**Psycops**


The Pakistani resistance still numbered in the 1,00,000 and pockets could take a lot of Indian lives to break, so India went on a pysop campaign. Pakistani wirless networks were spammed with “surrender and live” messages (India had cracked the cipher used in East Pakistan before the war itself), Sam Bahadur himself went on air and told Pakistanis that if they surrendered they would be treated honourably, and this cracked any vestige of resistance. Pakistani soldiers began surrendering to the Indian army in droves. Niazi signed the instrument of surrender (a bitter man) on 16th December and went into captivity, along with him 91,000 Pakistani troops also went into captivity.

Even back then, we were spammers.

Great read, though. /r/depthhub Thanks for this awesome post!. I want to know more about Warfare, can you suggest me some books that i can read ? 
  Don't 4get the brilliant operations Trident and Python of the Navy. V crippled the enemy and took no casualties in both operation.  Excellent post! Sam Manekshaw, JFR Jacob, PC Lal... the armed forces were exceptionally well led in that war!

You should start a blog. Reach a wider audience.  Pakistan got spanked in this war, no other way to put it. But aside from the loss of life, I'm glad we lost. Bangladesh should never have been part of Pakistan in the first place, and our leaders were doing them no favors. I don't know how true it is, but a lot of people say that during the war, General Yahya Khan was busy drinking and womanizing.  Thanks for the post. I was really looking forward to read this post once I reach home after work. Why the hell is this stuff not taught in schools. According to our text books we have absolutely no history after gaining independence.

You could have made this post on Independence day. Now you must post another one.  What? No reference to Heinz Guderian in maneuver warfare?! Poda!

But great post though! Interesting read, thanks for this. You should add some sources for further reading.

I read about [Sam Manekshaw](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Manekshaw) yesterday, extraordinary individual with a very decorated history. He even served against imperial Japan in WW2. The Soviet Union was also critical to this victory.  Nixon had sent the 7th Fleet into the Bay of Bengal on day 2 to shut down the Indian offensive via aerial and naval bombardment, but the USSR sent a nuclear sub to tail them, implicitly threatening nuclear war should Nixon do so. Gee thnx OP , not only did you mesmerize me with your narration, you have now I have all these books I want to read !

but seriously, thank you , this was brilliant. I saw a brilliant movie 1971, damn the ending still tears me up. What a brilliant actor Manoj Bajpayee is. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKHd6eZ4TLQ Since a number of people over here are asking for further reads, I would recommend this excellent book - ['The Blood Telegram'](http://www.amazon.com/The-Blood-Telegram-Kissinger-Forgotten/dp/0307700208), less from the Indian perspective, and more of Nixon's phobia towards India, and the resulting policies. I have somewhere read that one of the long term mistakes India made during the war was not capturing Pak/ Kashmir territory when they had the chance (as spoils of war) and instead retreating back to pre war positions, this squandered our effort and gains in the long term Okay I have a mildly irrelevant question: weren't Sam Manekshaw and Cariappa Field Marshals at the same time?  Thank you for this excellent analysis. [A life lived such - Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmPmm7QeIE) While I knew that the 71 war had created one of the largest number of PoWs, the detailed post really gave a lot of insights about the actions on ground. Thanks! Thanks a lot for this. I am very poor when it comes to history like this. Could you hyper link your sources? That way I can find related stuff on the internet. Thanks again. This is the kind of post I want to see in r/India. I love you guys. You should read Col. [David Glantz](http://www.great-victory1945.ru/glantz_3.htm) books/articles on WW2 conflict between USSR and German/Axis powers.

More recently [air cavalry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_assault) concept from Vietnam War and [Air-Land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirLand_Battle) and [Air-Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirSea_Battle) battle doctrine of US 

Some of your analogies to WW2 Germany and USSR could be more nuanced. While principles of maneuver warfare have been around and employed, there is a sea change between nazi doctrine (which was an amorphous collections of principles, often aiming to create a Kesselschlact (battle cauldron) and identifying the SchwerPunkt (focal point of attack) and Soviet combined arms doctrine. These also evolved over time, example [the first battle of smolensk was a disaster for Soviets, as Stalin insisted that they not retreat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Smolensk_\(1941\)) 

1971 Also saw one place in the east where the Indian army had a heavy slog of it with a more or less direct assault against a tenacious Pakistani commander who had taken advantage of local terrain (ditches etc)  . Will try to locate the reference from Bharat Rakshak or wiki. 

Pakistan strategy that defence of the east ""lies in the west"" and reliance on foreign support was shattered by the speed and preparedness of the Indian assault in the east, able diplomacy by India, local support by Mukti Bahini, and sufficient counterblow in the west to create a stalemate there. You might want to make more of a point of it.

One very minor mistake in a good post is the reference to Hitler's mistake in not manning the city of Berlin. This is an underappreciation of the situation at the end of the war and the local geography/times. The battle of berlin was conducted at natural fortification just outside and was one of the bloodiest and desperate battles of WW2. 

Also of note - The Burma campaign that turned back the japanese army has been cited as one of the largest defeats of the Japanese army ever. (guadalacanal was comparable, but viewed as less strategic and including japanese navy). The battle of Imphal and Kohima are under-rated, as is the achievement of the Chindits. Truly, this is the forgotten war. Perhaps partly because it was a British Indian army with british commanders, partly because the Japanese were at the end of their supply lines, partly because Bose was on the other side.  

The battle of [Keren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Keren) (a predecessor of Monte Cassino and Tiger Hill) , and other british indian exploits too warrant mentioning.

Neverthless the 1971 war was extremely notable, for all the reasons you mention and more. Great research but couple of points:

* The Maneckshaw offering to resign thing seems blown out of proportion. No one would seriously suggest attacking rainy flood-prone land in the monsoon. Since time immemorial monsoon has been off season for wars in India.

* All your references are by Indian writers who were actors in the war. ""Major element of genius provided by J.S. Arora"" and written about by J.S. Arora, am I right. Every decision victors make in a war becomes one of genius especially when victors write it. You should read some neutral reports. 

* I believe ""Slender was the Thread"" is about the 47-48 war and does not count here. INDIA IS DA BEST. SO PROUD OF MY CUNTRY.",2014-08-13 01:18:57
Reddiquette,Serious Question to AAP supporters. [Reddiquette],2chvdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2chvdi/serious_question_to_aap_supporters_reddiquette/,"Do you folks support AK or AAP and what it stands for? If tomorrow in a hypothetical world, the top 4 in AAP get removed in an intra party coup, would you still support AAP?

Or do you support AK, and AAP is incidental? 

"," I was a big AAP supporter and supported the idea behind it. Almost everything AK did pre-Delhi elections was in line with the idea. He then tried to become a politician. Something he is not good at. Congress dragged him to their level and beat him at it.

The coalition with Congress was his political hara-kiri. I support AAP in general, although I think AK is the main driving force in the party. I would still support them if the top 4 get removed, because I think they believe in something, and if they follow the same policies, I am fine with it. Although, I think AK is the reason they draw such crowds, he is pretty good at what he does.

Although I may disagree with some of their policies such as the anti-nuclear power stand. Also the unnecessary support for Gaza.

I still think they are the best thing to have happened to Indian politics. Being clean and corruption free is the most important thing, in my opinion.

Unfortunately, that is not the case in India. The corrupt and the thugs are rewarded, while the nice guys are sidelined. AAP is really necessary in Indian politics, more to keep the main parties in check.

AAP is the only party in support of bringing accountability for political parties. Both BJP and congress will never support RTI for political parties.

AAP is the only party which seriously opposes criminality in politics. You can see the hypocrisy in both BJP and congress where they provide lip service but when its their turn to implement it, they'll say its just ""politics"".

So as long as AK/AAP stand for cleaning up politics and jail the corrupt politicians, I will support them. We need AAP.

This is how electoral discourse happens in India now :

> INC: Hey BJP, You did X. That is bad.

> BJP: But INC, you did Y. Which is worse.

At the end, nothing gets done about X or Y. The two parties replace talking about the issues & instead talk about which 1 is holier.

AAP, with small history, can break this cycle. I will support anyone which brings the bill of swaraj.  As for Ak and just modi..  I some how trust them both to take a decision for the nation.  I didn't have that feeling for Congress or shiv sena or any other party. 

Some how after modi is done,  I don't trust anyone.. 

Ak has had for long been against the government and now he is trying to be the government to change it.  

If the 49 days was any indication then I will for a thousand times donate and trust them with my vote  [deleted] >Or do you support AK, and AAP is incidental?

It's the other way around. If AAP had some other leader I would still support. However, AK turns out to be quite an able administrator, apart from a few things like showbaazi and stuff. Having known his history and achievements, I can assuredly put my faith in him to do what he believes in. 

Transparency in functioning, anti-corruption stance, RTI, right to recall are all the principles that I strongly subscribe to and there I am not aware of a single political party that stands for them other than AAP. It's really the lack (or even the presence) of a non-shady political party that makes my support for AAP stronger.  

And as long as the core principles of AAP remain the same, any fallouts in the leadership is not gonna affect my support. I personally support the founding principles of AAP, to be a force to end corruption and bring accountability to government functioning.  I also think that both BJP and Congress are corrupt (to varying degrees), and don't have any incentive to end corruption.

I think a party like AAP even if they don't win a majority can be a voice of reason within the parliament.

So regarding your first query, I will keep supporting AAP through donations because they are my only source of hope in this muddled democracy.

As far as AK is concerned, I don't think he is a power-hungry maniac as some people tend to believe. They did make some mistakes like resigning from the Delhi government and trying to fight across India in general elections.

He basically tried to expand too fast, without having a robust fundamental structure in place. He failed. Many people saw this as an excellent opportunity to hit him when he is down. Obviously, pissing off the media and industrialists like Mukesh Ambani did little good. They went after him when they saw the opportunity post-elections.

I strongly believe he has the best interests of the country in mind. I also believe is a man of high integrity. He is interlinked with the AAP movement, and there is no separating the two.

So yes, I will keep supporting AK as well.
 yes i will still support AAP if it is lead by a person of clean image.I see only changing the current political scenario as respite from my troubles.the JLB,swaraj and their transparency regarding funds is good. TBH I don't support AAP. I just don't think they deserve much of the hate they get based on no facts. So to clear a few things:

1. AAP is no more a Congress B-Team than BJP
2. AAP is not full of Kashmir separatists
3. AAP is not a Maoist party

I have no idea how people believe all this crap. [deleted] [deleted] I support Both AAP and AK. both go hand in hand. Question is asked to create a distinction between AK and AAP. I hope you are not Arnab Goswami. 
 [Reddiquette] does nothing, it should be [R]

And with the Politics tag, you cannot have a [R] enforced thread, unless something changed I will always support AK.

I request all to **plzzzz** read this http://www.rmaf.org.ph/newrmaf/main/awardees/awardee/biography/141 So, is the person bigger or the idea? I support both (and I can't digest the fact that people are sticking to the traditional corrupt, communal parties). AK is not extremely intelligent (and may say stupid things from time to time), but his heart is at right place and he did things consistent with the principles of AAP (except the Delhi house thingy, which is a minor infraction). AAP does not matter . Its the idea they bring that matters. 

THe IDEA is integrity , accountability and 0 tolerance to corruption.  

I see humility to accept their mistake publicly and change. 

I see their stand for the community. 

And I also see all the behind the door strategies to subdue them. 

India could be a golden bird again and people would line up to migrate to india rather that other way around THIS IDEA came into existence. 
 I loved the idea, the movement and the support. I joined rallies, shouted slogans and actually celebrated when they won Delhi.

Then congress happened. And then 49 days. 

Lost faith.  To be honest, i don't know what they stand for anymore. They messed up big time after forming the government in Delhi. Some of their decisions regarding power and water supply were good but the weird agitation and antics (of Somnath Bharti and few others) seemed like they were trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator.
Before the Delhi elections, my dad was invited to one of their meetings. He said most of the people there were former BJP and Congress members. I just think AAP and AK both are not mature enough to rule. I can be wrong, but this was my personal feeling while voting in 2014 Lok Sabha.  I imagine if anything removal of Kejriwal, Salim Yadav, Bhushan, Sisodia, Ashutosh etc. would be a bonus.

But seriously speaking, even with these faces gone, what exactly does AAP represent? Anti-corruption? Okay, but what are their policies. A repeated subject of criticism is that their members come from all idealogical backgrounds from left to right(or, from Medha Patkar to Meera Sanyal) and as a party they have very few clearly defined policies and viewpoints.

Also their frequent Muslim appeasement, sometimes going to ridiculous levels(eg. Holding concerts and candlelight vigils for Gaza when the public is more concerned with Saharanpur and other domestic issues) really gets on many voters' nerves. Similarly the fuss they made over Batla House and 'open letter to Muslims' last year was a turn-off for many voters. I'd be more willing to support them if the top 4 got removed. There are probably a lot of decent people who are working for AAP and they are ones who should be running the party, not attention whores like AK. ",2014-08-04 01:20:19
Reddiquette,"Not a hater, but what happened to Swacch Bharat? (Reddiquette)",3zkjpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3zkjpo/not_a_hater_but_what_happened_to_swacch_bharat/,"I'm genuinely curious, because IIRC the government invested a LOT of money towards the program. Maybe they're doing work, but its not the media anymore.

Again, not a hater - I support Modi's economic vision."," The fact that you had to preface a statement with ""Not a hater"".... It is ongoing but at a very slow pace. I see a few public toilets in the Mumbai Hyderabad high way within 2km stretch which was surprising. But it's not happening as fast as it should. The UPA had a similar Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan program, which was a failure. [CAG even found alarming discrepancies in fund allocation and its misuse and also a clear failure in the implementation of the sanitation program.] (http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-nirmal-bharat-abhiyan-total-failure-cag-2153561)

Swachh Bharat, in all likelihood, is going the same way. Atleast to me, there is no visible outcome or change.

PS: Why do you have to keep justifying that you are not a hater, (not once but twice)? Ask your question boldly. If someone accuses you of something you are not, just ignore. No need to be this defensive that too upfront. What happened? 
People still blaming government for not doing thier job and continue to litter. 

One time, one of my uncle was driving me around in Delhi NCR. He was surprised to see that I kept my trash in my hand for hours until I found a trash can to throw it. When I asked the reason, he said I would have thrown it out from the window long time ago. He even told other people about it.

http://www.dnaindia.com/topic/swachh-bharat-mission

There are other updates too, just Google it. You are paying another tax now, that's what happened :) what else were you expecting :) In my town Belgaum Karnataka 

All pan shops have been given a dustbin to put outside their shop. 

Bus stand got cleaned. Railway station is clean. But the city is still dirty as usual. But I don't blame that on govt they clean dustbins and open dustbins daily. But a lot of opeople who still open gutka packet put it in mouth and throw the cover on the floor while standing next to a dustbin. They have also started a new drive for smokers they are giving metal pots for cigarette buds and told pan shops to enforce it some have some havnt Did you not see advertisements with Anupam Kher today? I don't have a clear idea about the cess. How does it work?

The funds from the cess go to Swacch Bharat Abhiyan; that much is clear.

So, how does a central government program seek to influence the efficiency of waste disposal and management at panchayat level and municipality level?

Is Swacch Bharat a cleanliness program or an awareness program about cleanliness? Swacch Bharat Cess is still there, I think. The campaigning is there no more, I think. Imho large ambitious culture changing government programs always fail. From 'big leap' to Jimmy Carter's attempt to reduce fossil fuel dependence they havr always always failed. 

Swachh Bharat can work as a branding exercise for several different infra improvement projects but I can't see how it will really bring any changes beyond that.  They are working not talking.  I don't know about anyone else, but where I live, this ""Swacch Bharat"" thing has failed miserably, completely.

The only thing that has been cleaned is the mayor's house, that retarded goon likes to litter his own place and then take photos of himself holding a mop. And then once his home is cleaned, the retard keeps claiming it as a remarkable achievement and first step to Swacch Bharat. Checking on this thread after 15 hours: the consensus seems that we should not litter. 
--
I still can't figure out the point of allocating crores when there's no unique problem solving for India's trash problem / our tendency to litter. more tax & seasonal topic for selfies/tweets.

Did you expect more than that ? Still people are loitering the spaces as before. Though Modi did a good job of bringing swacch bharat campaign he should have stopped the campaign with educating people to be clean and aware of cleanliness of their surroundings. Instead he started to impose swacch bharat cess which is not a good thing to do. Publicity should be given for swach bharat no doubt in that, but taxing people in name of swach bharat not good.

Reddiquette,Reddiquette : On Israel,25ussa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25ussa/reddiquette_on_israel/,"I made some obviously controversial statements that set many a knicker ablaze, didn't want to go about responding to each and every one of these individually, and also thought it would be good to have fresh thread talking from the non Israeli Pov.

Before I start - seriously, I now understand how it feels to be at the receiving end of my right wing brethren, I have been called an anti-Semite (how, questioning a country's policies and it's government makes me an anti anything is beyond me), weed smoking hippie, delusional Palestinian apologist amongst other stuff, my question to you folks who insist on needless ad-hominem is this, 

Can't one have a view which is contrarian to yours? Must everybody see the world only from your prism? Why needless ad-hominem? Everybody can indulge in it, but what would be the outcome? We would only be slinging insults at each other which mean nothing in real life and civil discourse is given the go by.

Once more onto the breech!!! but before I substantiate the claims I had made, some commonly repeated lines of reasoning need to be rebutted.

**Israel is surrounded by enemies & it's very survival is in question, so it has the right to do whatever it feels like doing**

* This was true in 47, this was true in 67 (which is where the seeds of the current conflicts were sown), but it is absolutely not true in 2014 (or not for the past 25-30 years at the least).

* It's major opposition has been completely neutralised - Egypt? It has a peace accord which both have respected, likewise Jordan, Iraq is out of the equation, Iran's nuclear plans have been neutralised and while on paper it remains a credible threat, the reality is that the whole world knows, if Iran even makes a hint of a hostile move in this region against any country, let alone Israel, it will feel the full impact of the US military (and maybe NATO as a whole)...so Iran is clearly not a threat. That leaves us states like Lebanon (which has it's own problems, largely caused by Israeli policies, and has shown that left to it's own tends to gravitate towards a fairly tolerant model).

* In terms of defence budgets, in terms of quality of manpower, training, equipment (all Uncle Sam's blessings mostly) the IDF is far and away miles ahead of it's closest competitors, so this whole ""Israel under siege"" nonsense needs to be put to rest.

**Israel is this utopia for Israeli Arabs**

* At the outset, one cannot but be blind to the fact that Israeli arabs have far more rights in Israel than in any other major Islamic country, only a fool will deny it, but it still has some serious questions raised on how Israeli arabs are treated as second class citizens with serious cries of even an almost apartheid like state in many areas and there are moves to constitutionalise this in the form of the [Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_proposal:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People), [some more on this](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/04/binyamin-netanyahu-israel-jewish-state).

Historically this goes against what it's founder David Ben Gurion wanted - he wanted (and had his way when the constitution of Israel was framed) Arabs to be treated equally, and no discrimination at all to be practiced. At the time Israel was formed, he went all out to assure Arabs that they will be treated well in Israel and requested Arab's to stay back in their villages and homes. Now in a classic case of fear mongering (similar to the one in India), Muslim leaders warned of a genocide of Arab's & Muslims and succeeded in winning over their people and thus began a massive exodus.

This hawkish stance of Israel in recent times is what I as an observer of that region deride - if when truly surrounded by enemies, Israel could afford to be magnanimous, what is the need now to disenfranchise Arabs? How different (in spirit if not in actual themes) is this different from the [Nuremberg laws?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws)

How can, *Arabs are second class citizens in Israel, but are better off than in other Arab countries ever be an excuse for this discrimination*? Is Tu quoque ever a solution? When a country like Israel with it's history of treating Muslims, Arabs well (Israeli) over time becomes exceedingly hawkish and discriminatory, does it not require wide condemnation? 


Now, to address the points I had made.

**Israel consistently violates agreement's it has signed or agreed to sign in negotiations with the PLO / Palestinian Arabs**

A couple of Wiki links on stuff like this alone will not suffice, they barely even scratch the surface of the reality that is Israel's duplicituous and perfidious stance when it comes to dealing with the Palestinians.

Let me as an example address Madrid. /u/pbdirigible says no agreement was signed in Madrid as that is what Wiki will tell you.

Reality went like this,

* As a precondition to Madrid, Israel wanted a UN resolution - resolution # 3379 struck off it's books (revoked), the US and the Arabs agreed to this and it was done.

* Yizhtak Shamir then wanted an unconditional loan guarantee of $ 10 billion from the US (which was later given without any fuss to the next Israeli regime to form the government), but the Bush proposal of wanting specific guarantees from Israel on troop reduction from the occupied territories was outright rejected. Bush stood firm on this, and Shamir had to back down.

* Then came the new effort at stalling the process - Shamir and Israel outright rejected PLO negotiators (though PLO was as per the previous resolution 3379 granted observer status and was the defacto political entity representing the Palestinians), he got his way.

* Then Israel played it's final trump card - Madrid won't see any Israeli negotiation, but it will broadly agree on the items to be negotiated (troop withdrawals, and Israeli withdrawal from the illegally occupied territories). These two items had been a condition of the ceasefire after the Yom Kippur war - [Resolution 242](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242) and [Resolution 338](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242), the Palestinians (secretly operating on behalf of the PLO) agreed. By this time Shamir had lost the elections (he was seen as too hawkish even by the Israeli's) and Rabin had come to power - he said **Israel WILL HONOUR it's commitments, and slowly start phased troop withdrawals and got the $ 10 BN loan**...and then promptly Israel went back on it's words. It did hold 5 other parleys, in which they stalled the entire process (Palestinian demands were simple, do what Israel has repeatedly promised to do) till it collapsed without anything emerging from it.

This level of duplicity was then seen in Oslo, to go into that at length would mean too much of a digression, but suffice to say that Israel played the same game of making promises (This time in an accord, so no disputing it) and then promptly going back on them. From the previous parleys and UN resolutions, Israel forced Arafat to something called three tier zones - in which Palestinian self governance was recognised ONLY in Zone A which was a very truncated area, this buried all Israeli promises, UN resolutions, Security council resolutions finally - of course, now, they are encroaching onto even zone A.

I will keep adding to this post as it is taking me time to draft these. I hope that my rabid right winger bretheren cool down on the ad-hominem, don't call me a pot smoking hippie who pulls stuff from his arse and respond with facts, figures and opinions formed out of those.

Interestingly enough, I was also a hard core Israel supporter till 5-6 years ago, when a lot of reading from the Palestinian perspective gave me a whole lot to think about.

Some must read to get a balanced perspective (if you are interested in a balanced perspective that is)

* [The Great War for Civilisation by Robert Fisk](http://www.amazon.in/The-Great-War-Civilisation-Conquest/dp/1400075173) - This is a MUST READ for anybody interested in understanding the politics in the Middle East

* [Lords of the Land](http://www.amazon.in/Lords-Land-Settlements-Occupied-Territories/dp/1568584148/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400410129&sr=1-1&keywords=Lords+of+the+Land%3A+The+War+Over+Israel%27s+Settlements+in+the+Occupied+..) - the paperback is atrociously expensive, but most uni libraries stock it, or the Kindle version is only Rs 500 or so.

* The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A History by Ian Bickerton - provides some solid insight into the roots of the conflict. I paired this with some fictional work by Leon Uris, gave me a good flavour for the period.

* Fictional works by Leon Uris (just for the flavour, he does some solid research)

* Israel the West Bank and International Law - The definitive work on the legal aspects (various UN resolutions, the whole legality of the Israeli occupation etc), a little dry, but interesting if you can break through the whole dry style.

Note - I have referenced Wiki as a starting point, but my main citations would be from the books I have referred, though please don't expect me to start quoting page numbers - I am not quoting directly from these (and other books I have not mentioned here), but my ideas and opinions were framed by these.

Is this a conscious attempt to show your liberal side? I am not disparaging dissent, just asking if this was written self-consciously? >Before I start - seriously, I now understand how it feels to be at the receiving end of my right wing brethren

:)

It might be a sweeping generalisation, but in my opinion, the right wing support for Israel is only because of the fact that the oppressed people are Muslims. If they were Hindus, the situation would have been completely different. 

I fail to see how a state which routinely razes down Palestinian homes and has brazenly driven out people from their own country can be considered anything but inhumane.  [deleted] One of the major issues with understanding the actions of the israeli gov't is that people try to make a general sense of the conflict and sometimes even try to find patterns in the rhetorics used by both sides.

The sad truth is that in the middle east trying to generalize and find patterns doesnt work. israelis and arabs from in and around the region (and im talking specifically about the [Mashriq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashriq) region)
are divided in most cases. arabs who live in ramallah come from different hamula(family) then arabs who live in jenin or jericho and some cities are basically shared by 2-3 families that have conflict with other families from other cities and using assault rifles to solve those conflict is pretty common.

most arab villages have 1-2 families in them and in some cases they wont even let their girls marry with people from other villages.

Different arab families immigrated to israel in different times and their social and financial status reflect that.

israelis are divided by countries of origin and the year they immigrated to israel. jewish-israeli citizens who experience the tensions can even spot them in political decisions and economic trends.

Those issues make it almost impossible to have an unbiased academic research on culture or history within the region.
the amount of information you need to understand the region is too big and without living in israel and experiencing day to day life in different parts of israel i dont see how anyone could understand whats happening here.

 >Before I start - seriously, I now understand how it feels to be at the receiving end of my right wing brethren, I have been called an anti-Semite (how, questioning a country's policies and it's government makes me an anti anything is beyond me), weed smoking hippie, delusional Palestinian apologist amongst other stuff, my question to you folks who insist on needless ad-hominem is this

 
That's because a good part of all deeply anti-Zionist people are most of those things. Not all of them, not even the majority, but a good non-token part of them, they are antisemites embarrassed of their antisemitism using zionists as their to-go word for everything wrong in the world. Same thing with everything else, basically, nowadays being a racist is not ""cool""  so people hide their racism in ways that are socially acceptable (misogynists don't hate women anymore, they hate feminists; xenophobes don't hate brown people anymore, they hate Islam, and so on. Not all the people who hate feminists and Islam are misogynists or xenophobes, but a good part of them are). 

You, on the other hand, seem like a smart person who simply but respectfully disagrees with me and my worldview. Which is why I upvoted you, even if I'm one of the most right-wing Israelis on reddit as a whole; good debate can and should be had, but good debate is not spamming a YouTube video of definitive proof of a Rothschild Zionist conspiracy to control the world. 

Or to give you another example, somebody like yourself would be very welcome to post in r/Israel and debate about whatever you want, as you are a rational person with a different mindview. Somebody like this person http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25rnou/israels_prime_minister_netanyahu_congratulates/chk7jhf would not be, as he is most certainly an antisemitic asshole hiding behind good old Zionism to post his shit.  > receiving end of my right wing brethren..Please point me to the specific thread. I'd like to know about what the views of this ""right wing brethren"" are. 1. You referenced ""Israel's Constitution"".  In fact, Israel does not have a constitution.

2. Why did Arafat walk away from the Clinton Parameters in 2000-01?  Read what Bill Clinton wrote on the subject.

3. Without Palestinian recognition of Israel, as a Jewish State, in whatever borders are agreed to, the conflict will not truly be over.  Only an agreement that ends all present and future claims on both sides will be worth the paper it is written on.

4. Discrimination--it exists in Israel and in many other places, and is extensive in India. So long as Israel and the Palestinians are in a state of conflict, you should not be surprised that it exists.  To compare it to the Nuremberg Laws indicates you may not know too much about them.  Sorry if I am being honest.  Bear in mind, as well, the rhetoric about Jews and Israel used in Palestinian media?  Also, did it ever occur to you to ask the Palestinians what they want and are willing to accept?    You might find that it is not at all what you ASSUME they would agree to.  

BTW, have you ever had a look at the PEW global attitudes survey?  

Full disclosure--I support the Clinton Parameters and the likely Kerry Plan, and don't at all like the current Netanyahu regime.  I also think if an agreement based on the Clinton Parameters is not possible, Israel should unilaterally withdraw to the security wall.  I agree, mostly, with the basic spirit of what you write and am sure you are well meaning. I can only suggest you think more about what the Palestinians really want and are willing to accept, not what you imagine they want and also, whether the current situation is not a consequence of the failure of the Camp David/Clinton Parameters talks?    
 Don't know much about the subject,  except that I like Israel,  and I support it's political decisions

Reddiquette,Cong Men shut down the eatery opposite KEM Hospital over bill note,1iuxg0,http://www.mid-day.com/news/2013/jul/230713-congress-men-shut-down-eatery-over-bill-note.htm,," So apparently Congress party members could not handle some criticism. Well no surprises here

- they expect news anchors to remain mum when their party members justify terrorism, 
- they expect opposition and media to turn the other way when being called soft on Chinese incursions, 
- they expect media not to raise questions about their party members's complicity in scams because matter is sub-judice and calling things a media-trial, 
- they expect people to not call out their hypocrisy when lokpal needs ""all-party-concensus"", but food security bill that can put tremendous pressure on the already bad inflation can be put thru an ordinance because ""bribe to people"" is the only way to win elections now, 
- they expect us to believe that only others are communal, but they, the most communal of all are ""self appointed"" certificate authority of the secularism in the country

Edit: 
Just for [comparison sake](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-01/mumbai/37372247_1_ac-restaurants-service-tax-restaurant-owner) the service tax (luxury tax) is approximately 5% of the entire bill. In a country like India with not-very-great tipping culture, even the tip to a working class waiter will be less than 5% of the bill amount. But, approximately 5% of the entire food bill goes to the coffers of a corrupt government who will eventually end up making a multi-crore scam out of it and make the money vanish instead of using it for public good.  This was a harmless expression of social protest. He wasn't hurting anyone high up in the Congress, no thousands of people were queuing up and chanting slogans here, not even another political party was interested in what was happening here.

It's a really sad day that Congress felt the need to go and snuff this out. The insecurity, the arrogance ... its mindboggling. The guy so calmly said that this was all done by non-legal channels and he should express himself through legal ways, WHILE using his political clout to get his shop closed. Over a goddamn two line statement at the end of a fucking bill. >Youth Congress leaders expressed surprise that **despite all the work they put in for the greater good of the people, some failed to notice it.** “We are doing such good work in our areas as part of the Youth Congress and such comments de-motivate people from joining the party.

Oh boo-hoo, let me play you a sad song on the world's smallest violin. Wow! Taking on a small business for some harmless fun is the way to go. And they talk about moral policing of the BJP all the time. Can't blame the owner removing those lines, he's got a business to run. NSUI, eh?

Let me just leave this news article about the NSUI Mumbai wing president from last month :

http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/1831516/report-nsui-mumbai-president-suraj-thakur-suspended-for-dirty-dancing This reminds me of an incident in the 80s. A ""talent show"" on All India Radio was hosting some children, and the host asked a child to recite a poem. The child went ""Gali Gali me shor hai, Rajiv Gandhi chor hai"" (Roughly translated, every one knows, Rajiv Gandhi is a thief).

Congress workers beat up the host, and had him fired from his job. Didnt save Rajiv's govt in the next elections though. Fuck, Never in a million years would  I have thought my post in reddit would have such undesirable consequences. I guess I have to blur out the name of a person or institution who insults congress next time I post.  NUSI goons are worse the VHP goons. Fuck them  Literally no hope for the nation when you have a ""youth"" party doing this. At least when it comes to the old guys, there is the hope for change when they die off.

Ah who am I kidding, mera bharath mahan!

EDIT - How in the bloody hell is this defamation??  >The owner might have his issues but he should fight them in a legal way rather than defaming the party for some people’s corruption,” said Sandeep Pansade, general secretary, south-central region of Youth Congress. 

Yes, why, of course Mr. Pansade. Because freedom of speech is superseded by the archaic IPC! And you guys wouldn't love to change it.

And good for you Congress, that a large section of the Indian population still believe you will be the last ones to encroach upon their freedoms! An **anonymous** site owner complained that **alleged** NaMo fans threatened him to shut down a satire site (a copied one at that). No proof was given for that and still all hell broke loose. Commentaries were being passed, editorials were being written, TV-debates were being organized ,verdicts were being passed -- all in all the outrage industry was in full flow..

Now **Congress goons**, **IN REAL LIFE**, force a restaurant to be shut down because the hotel had the gumption to print certain **bitter truths** in their bill footer. The livelihoods of many people have been directly affected. Now will the outrage industry please put up its hands ? 

I guess not. Because as loyal dogs, you are expected to bark only when the master tells you to. Congress the haat aam aadmi ke saath. 

Criticize congress and then their haat is in your gaand.  Liberal towards whom? Certainly not this eatery owner.. Fuck! I feel so powerless. 

I wonder what *we* can do about this. Oh, for THIS they act immediately. When shit that actually matters happens, the reaction time difference is astonishing. Does Amartya Sen have an opinion on this now?  Congress pet pooches already [swinging into action](https://twitter.com/waglenikhil/status/359553362158555138) It's pouring in Bombay, there is apathy on the road in the form of traffic, train delays etc and yet these Congress workers chose to focus their energies on pulling down this restaurant than help commuters stranded everywhere.

Speaks volumes on the governance system in Maharashtra right now. When you get shut down for speaking about criminals, you are being ruled by criminals welcome to democracy ! why the downvotes? Pakis at it again? I am pretty sure the eatery will be back - but these guys are super assholes for not having the balls to take criticism. Can't blame them, its in the party's genes. Congress, Shiv Sena...they're all the same. There is no true protection for freedom of speech in India, unfortunately.  Jusy came to comment I fapped to many a Mid Day girls in days past. Carry on **Congress is secular** *^only ^when ^it ^comes ^to ^destroying ^the ^country ^and ^betraying ^the ^citizens. Ask help of sena. We are so used to this shit now that we don't even question how they could legally do this and whether a court will support them. All we ask is why they did it. now can we start the revolution?  i mean we the people are becoming a joke.  we will take anything from anybody.

we should stop trying to influence others and debate endlessly and just find like minded people and start our revolution. Freedom of Speech in India is just a concept, not reality. See what Narendra Modi says........http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/mumbai-eatery-closure-height-of-intolerance-says-narendra-modi_864001.html I wish more restaurants start including such disclaimers in their bills from now!

I hope the restaurant gets to reopen fast & the owner gets to print whatever he wants in the bill. lol thats what you get for lying about UPA. [removed] Fucking congis

We will show these fuckers once Modiji is PM. truth alone triumphs? :( These goons must be dying to find out our identities after reading our comments. We are a danger to their rule.

Lets talk about future, suppose a service like Netflix is started in India, which becomes so famous, that almost, 50-60% of population is on Netflix on sunday, using more than 50-60% of total bandwidth available with that technology, wouldn't it decrease the bandwidth of an emergency service, or Hospital, or research lab, or defense services.

http://www.bbc.com/news/business-20590169



This lead me to a link from Infosys, 
http://www.infosys.com/finacle/solutions/thought-papers/Documents/why-India-needs-islamic-banking.pdf


Here is why we actually need it:

1.  Interest free loans to all, No bank fees
2.  Could ethically be appealing to the Poorest Sections of India -         Muslim

Please Do read the Infosys report before commenting, the two reasons above are primary reasons why it would make sense

About me: brahmin hindu, born  and living in Mumbai since 1994. 
 

I want to know what, R/india thinks about this,

These may also lead to communal violence  which makes me wonder that if these banks will be target if there are problems in the city. "," From all that I have read about the implementation, there is no functional difference except for terminology by calling interest as profit. 

Edit:

The infosys report cites twocircles.net as a reference. Also here is a report, [Islamic Banking is a Myth](http://www.dawn.com/news/881273/islamic-banking-is-a-mere-myth) on it from Dawn.
Also this by the tribune, [Is Islamic banking as exploitative as conventional banking?](http://tribune.com.pk/story/538577/is-islamic-banking-as-exploitative-as-conventional-banking/). Pakistan has these banks already that is why I am citing their papers. Though i don't support it. There is already one Muslim bank. It runs with support of Hdfc bank. People have a large misconception about Islamic Banking. This is due to the fact that everybody tries to provide opinions without understanding what Islamic Banking is. 

No, it does not provide any advantage to Muslims. All it does is provide a loophole to muslims because interests are forbidden in Islam.

Let me give a small example of how it works.

Say, you are buying a car for 6 Lakhs and you decide to take a normal loan. He might put around 15% interest rate over 4 years and the EMI would come to around 15,000 per month. You end up paying 8 lakhs over the course of 4 years. In this case, you are buying the car directly from the dealer.

Now, in Islamic Banking, you don't buy the car directly from the dealer but through the bank. What this means is that the bank buys the car from the dealer and then sell it to you. The banks doesn't sell you the car for 6 lakhs but they would sell it to you for a higher, fixed amount - say 8 lakhs. This 8 lakhs would be split into monthly installment. So, in effect you are not paying any interest technically. 

Both normal banking and islamic banking would more or less cost the same to the customer. It just makes the process legal under Islam How do they make profit?, to the OP: would encourage you to not shout or whisper about your caste .... the sooner we get rid of our caste tags (branded on us by birth) the better the country will progress !   

how does it sound if you declare yourself as ""caste-less"" ?   <apologies for deviating from the topic !> Yes, interest free loans are sure to help keep inflation down. (sic)

If not why is the downvote button there to begin with? Did you just tell an Indian what he/she can/cannot do and expect such advice to be followed? Oops. We tend not to listen...usually. I think most of the users here were first into digg. The same bury culture is in vogue here. uh guy, we dont need you lecturing us on fancy rules. am indian. there are no rules. just hazy guidelines and such. but we know better. We are Indian. We don't like rules. Why, cause that's hip and happening. We want to portray ourselves as advanced, intelligent beings who have invented things long before these European jokers, who have risen up from their sub-human medieval barbaric lives only in the past 200 or so years, while Indian civilization goes back to time immemorial. We don't take instructions from these neophytes, we define what we do and what is good for us and we do it (sorry, there is no such thing as ""define"" as we don't believe in such things as definitions and rules as they are ""rules"" and hence intrinsically binding and restrictive). We believe we had already invented, eons ago, all things that modern science purports to have recently discovered, thus proving our superiority, hence we do not have to answer to anyone or to bow to discipline. In the new age, there are no rules, other than what we define. We have long ago discovered the universal, all encompassing nature of the individual, and we don't like having restrictions of objectivity and discipline being thrust on us. Places like reddit are where we can be truly free and display our love for openness (and tolerance) and our disdain for puritanical, archaic and dogmatic philosophies like following rules (yuck!) set by someone else, as it lowers our dignity and rights as free thinkers and innovators in this modern world.

Don't ask us to follow rules, we will down-vote you into oblivion if you do! No one follows the reddiquette to the core over here. Earlier downvoting was a curse when we didn't have the sub-reddits.

Reddiquette,[Reddiquette] Why is Modi the only one being accused by his detractors of being dictatorial?,23urs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/23urs1/reddiquette_why_is_modi_the_only_one_being/,"I hear this often, that he is dictatorial, that he allows no dissent etc [one such example](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140322/jsp/opinion/story_18095590.jsp#.Uz00e_mSxF-)

As I have bias towards him, would love to read why his detractors feel that way.

That being said, aren't all of India's politicians solo leaders who brook ZERO intra party dissension? At least Modi had to fight his own party to stake the claim of first among equals, whereas people like a Sonia, Rahul or Jaya or Mulayam are uncontested leaders of their parties.

Take the rise of Sonia, she quelled all dissent, ruthlessly shut down eminent people like Narashima Rao, chose to operate the PM via remote control, thereby denigrating the role of the PM as the head of state who constitutionally has only the President above him, has her ""eyes & ears"" in all aspects of governance, who has despite holding all the reins of power been a reculse and has given maybe 2,3 interviews at best in 10 years. Whose son has the gumption to tear up a Cabinet ordinance and proclaim it as nonsense...how is any of this not fascist or dictatorial?

We need not even go down to the regional parties where people like Mulayam, Maya or Jaya lord it up like kings & queens.

Modi on the other hand, has had to fight his claim to be CM of Guj, has had to fight his way to be the face of the BJP, he still has his powerful detractors within the BJP. He has despite his detractors saying otherwise, given many many interviews over the past 10 odd years, and who has no family that will follow his footsteps as though it is some divine right.

I truly would like to understand why he is feared as being a potential despot."," The truth of the matter seems to be that many people cannot get over 2002 and the BJP's communal reputation. However that is seen as a tired, redundant argument today so they instead attack the BJP on everything else that other parties and leaders are usually given a pass on.

That is the impression I have gotten. The Congress is run by a single family and most of the regional parties are run by 1-2 prominent leaders, yet it is only Modi's dictatorial style that is focused on by critics. Most parties in UP had some involvement in Muzzafarnagar riots but the BJP is singled out. And so on. Which of the accusation made on Modi,let alone being a dictator is logical? They (haters) want to belittle him one way or other by calling him divisive,polariser,fundamentalist and whatnot.As if their opinions matter to him.

[Previous threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search/?q=Weekly%20mental%20health%20support%20thread&restrict_sr=1&sort=new)"," I just want to drop by & confess something. 

I’ve had depression for quite awhile, atleast I think so. It’s difficult to find any motivation to do something productive some days. There’re times when I’m completely disinterested in my hobbies. Right here I’ve to admit, gaming & playing guitar were my primary get away resources but still I would, at certain times find it difficult to continue for more than a couple of minutes if at all I do pick it up. 

Regardless, all I want to say to whoever reading this thread and is going through hard times or even clinically prescribed depression. Depression is just another sickness, it’s not a shame or disgraceful to admit to it. Seek out a counsellor if you need to talk to someone about it. Worst case get medications prescribed and definitely visit a psychologist. 

Stay well & be safe, friends. You’ll be through it eventually. Can somebody help me understand why people avoid me so much? I’ve been working since 15 years now, but can’t get a single person to agree to be my reference. It’s not that I’ve been a bad employee either. My appraisals have always been stellar and I have a huge body of work to show for it. But people outright ignore my requests, which I keeps potential employers from extending an offer.

This is beginning to affect my mental health, especially since I’m fast approaching an age where being made redundant is common and painful. How does one constantly give themself motivation/discipline? Having a really hard time figuring that out Without a job again. Had a job for a month, fought with manager who turned really toxic cuz of his expectations. Feels lonely and desparate. Have a few things going in terms of plans though, but reminding myself to keep rowing. Everyone is gone. My ex, my friends. No one left. Its just me and my misery. Last week was horrendous. Was moved to a new team and new location which gives me anxiety. Decided to take some time for myself on Friday, went to a cafe, ordered coffee and read for a couple of hours, after a long time. Isolation does good, sometimes. Then went on to get a couple of beers as well. It really helped me relax my mind and self reflect. Decided that I am gonna do this more often. Can someone help me get over my fear of a subject ? If you see my last post you'll know what I mean, but right now I can't even seem to be able to touch my books because I'm scared of it Hey guys. Can't seem to not be attached to my ex. We ended cos she said she'd lost feelings for me cos of the distance, took me a while to come to terms with it, but I did. 

And we talked quite frequently even after. But I decided to take a month's break from her cos I wanted to get over the attachment. However, for some reason, after all this, we barely talk now. I've explained everything to her, but to no avail. 

How should I be going about it? Having another existential crisis lately. I can't seem to find meaning or a point to do anything. I panic thinking about these thoughts and can't seem to have found peace with it. The worst part is except romantically (which I am affected by, a lot, but that's another story) my life is sorted. I have a good job, I make music, I enjoy my hobbies.


It feels sometimes like everything I did in my life I did for making friends. I still have that school trauma haunting me where I was left alone by myself without friends, and I had developed this kind of survival mechanism where I used to do stuff to impress folks and sort of 'prove' that I'm cool. I still am seeking that acceptance from people and it's killing me.



I've never gotten it anywhere yet. I have done some cool stuff, but no one is dying to talk to me let alone meet me. It kills me from inside that I have to do every cool thing under the hood to gain the slightest amount of approval.


Inb4 people don't matter, well I want some friends to hit me up on the regular. I've never had that ALL my fucking life. Is that too much to ask? All the feel good stuff gone down the drain in a jiff. I hate myself. So, I am planning to go to a doctor to get myself sorted out. The thing is, I dunno whether I should go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist. I feel meds is what I need because I am constantly sad or always nihilistic and shit. But my friend is asking me to go to a psychologist first and see what that person says as meds can have other effects on me.

Regardless, what should I expect when I go to either of them? It's going to be my first time. So anything about what to expect would help. I daydream a lot and talk to myself many times,can someone please tell me some solution to get rid of this problem. Any philosophical / mental health books/readings recommendations?",2019-09-08 17:02:33

A colleague was saying ""educated people should never run country they cannot take brave steps like Modi does"".. People seriously don't care about economy all they care about is Pakistan and Kashmir. BJP is doing right ... We are fucked boys More on current situation:

>Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh: It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector's growth is tottering at 0.6%. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the govt to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.


In such distressed time for economy, even [few words](https://twitter.com/INCIndia/status/1168018140971905024?s=19), even a criticism (though he rarely criticize anybody) by him is like rain in drought...

Wish he had majority in parliament like the incumbent PM, wish he could implement his knowledge and experience to grow India into superpower... My father runs a business in the automotive industry and says that this is the worst slowdown he's seen is 25 years. He says even 2008 was better and that was during a global recession. Factories halting or running 2/7 days, bodyshops shutting down or halting orders etc(throughout India). These are really troubling times. I hope that change is forced quickly or we'll stunt ourselves for a really long time. I don't know how competent the people in charge of the decisions regarding finances are. 

You just pick anyone random and make him/her the finance Minister. I know they don't make the decisions themselves, have a team of supposedly experts behind them, but I won't be surprised if the so called experts may also just be bootlickers rather than competent individuals.

And it should not be tough to find competent people in our country. Check out the comments in any article reporting the same.. bhakths out in full force abusing him..to solve a problem you have to admit that you have one. Cow economics and ram mandir finally taking effect. Acche din bros. He's not wrong. This guy is hands down *the* greatest Prime Minister the country has ever had. No politics, no drama, no braggadocio, no bullshit. He wasn't tainted by crises like Indira Gandhi or Nehru, either. He was all work and no talk. He singlehandedly pulled India out of the mouth of a potential economic depression in 1991 and helped set it on the right track as Prime Minister. 2004 to 2009 saw stratospheric economic growth and even 2009-2014, despite the global financial turbulence, was pretty impressive. No amount of praise will be enough for his contributions to India's growth story. 

But, today's hateful, terrorist-electing India doesn't deserve him. Today's India deserves Yogi Adityanath, Sakshi Maharaj, Pragya Singh Thakur, Amit Shah and that failed theater actor-cum-riot-monger.

Being an Indian i am inclined to support my country's intrest but at the same time if the people in Jammu and Kashmir are really being subdued that's not what i stand for. I am yet to find any unbiased piece on these recent developments so if anyone can recommend a well written unbiased article i will be thankful. The sad reality is no nation cares about Kashmiris. We all can pretend that we do, Pakistan can pretend it does, China can pretend it does too but the reality is the fight is all about land and water resources. You can try to give it religious angle, you can try to give it independence angle, you can try to give it human rights angle. But if one nation backs down other will take place, if second one backs down, third will take place.
Kashmir is unfortunate to pressed between 3 nuclear powers and that shatters their dream of true independence. Lance Naik Sandeep Thapa has lost his life in ceasefire violation by Pakistan in Nowshera Sector, Rajouri; firing underway.

Really interesting take on this issue from another angle. It's biased towards the viewpoint of the Army/Govt but it is necessary to read both sides of the argument rather than just merely looking at your own preferred side and going BJP==Nazi or that all Kashmiris==ISIS. The Kashmiri POV has been very well presented by the recent Jean Dreze documentary and I find that Pundita has been doing decently at showcasing the rationale for the excessive/draconian security measures from the Govt's POV. He's definitely better than Aditya Raj Kaul or Arti Tikoo Singh who seem to be nothing more than boring shills. I've been so conflicted about this lately. I was one of those people who celebrated the move when I found out about it. But now I can't be intellectually honest with myself and say that what's happening is right. If I were a Kashmiri, I would 100% disagree with all that's going on. So why should I support a move others are affected by when I wouldn't have supported it had I been on the other side? I mean, we're supposed to be the ""good"" guys. We were supposed to be the democratic country as opposed to our Pakistani and Chinese neighbours. Aren't we supposed to be better?

OTOH, what's the alternative? The rut we were in for the last few decades didn't do shit. So how do we fix it? India would never realistically allow for a plebiscite. So what would be a realistic step in the right direction? Scraping of article 370 at the cost of democracy?

I don't think I would be this conflicted if I were from, say, Luxembourg. Which means that the inherent bias that comes from being an Indian is clouding my judgement. And any rationalisation that comes from my sense of loyalty to my country is flawed for this reason. I want to be objective about this but it's so difficult to see what the right course of action here is.

I want to see happy Srinagar locals hoisting the tricolour on Lal Chowk.

Zee News / Republic TV, Where are you at? Governor could have invited Mufti and Abdullah for flag hoisting. It will be interesting to see if they turn up. Come to Canada. Nobody has culture or identity or home land. Only a few select groups like the native India's live in a separation like apartheid.

Our parents simply sell our family home and move somewhere else. Half the people get divorced or don't get married at all, even fewer have children.

Kashmiri's seem willing to sacrifice it all for their identity. Amazing, they would never fit in Canada, except they would try to live in a cultural bubble and send money back home. So this happened

The amount of pain this has caused to Pakistanis is insane. They're actually acting as if we've taken over Lahore or something. Truth of the matter is that at the end of the day this is just an administrative change and all the alienation, the terrorism, the separatism etc remains. In all, the Kashmir Valley has faced three waves of genocide, leading to the complete annihilation of Hindu and Sikh populations in Pakistani-administered Kashmir

Pakistanis slaughtering a cow on the Indian flag to “own” and insult India on its independence day. This is not a normal society. They are a stain on this planet. They do not deserve our taxes or any foreign: Imam of peace aid](https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1163350800686391296?s=19) I noticed a few negative comments in this thread. For them, let me remind you India has had several crisis before, e.g. Khalistan movement, followed by Operation Blue star, followed by IG's death and anti-sikh riot, 1989-91 Kashmir uprising & the killings of pandits, Babri demolition 1992 and followed by riot in several places, 2002 Gujrat riot, etc. Thousands lost their life!

This time govt prepared themselves. They worked out a detailed plan so that their is minimum or no loss of life. No body likes communication clampdown and detention of political leaders, but without these steps there could have been mayhem as big as anti-sikh riot or bigger. Are we not slightly better position now? 

Situation in Jammu and Ladakh division is near normal. Kashmir division is still under curfew, but govt did relax curfew to some extent in some areas and they will do so again tomorrow for Friday prayer. Of course, there will be protest. That's fine, but at least no loss of life yet.

I have faced curfew and communication clampdown for 4 days when I was travelling north-east last year with my family. It's horrible experience. I could hear gunshots from my hotel room. Sikhs and Khashi tribal were on killing mode. Later a few Assamese also added fuel to the fire. Cars were burning. Locals said they are used to with such incidents. Was there any alternative to curfew? Video which press club on India didn't allow to be screened 

https://youtu.be/Z5z-CxOkm18 As far as I know, people of Ladakh are happy, people of Jammu are happy. As far as Kashmir goes, there really is not a lot of coverage from that area due to the blackout. Though the blackout and curfew is sort of required to make sure a massive conflict/violence/terrorism activity does not happen, it has also hampered anyone from getting any reaction out of that area. As far as US media goes, they generally harp on about everything even after knowing nothing. Most of the US media is a war mongering machine. British media just loves to sprinkle salt on such things and enjoy. So be it Indian media or International media, take everything with a grain of salt.

**Operation Searchlight** was a planned military operation carried out by the [Pakistan Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army) to curb the [Bengali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal) nationalist movement in the erstwhile [East Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Pakistan) in March 1971,[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight#cite_note-Ganguly-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight#cite_note-Banglapedia-10) which the Pakistani state retrospectively justified on the basis of [anti-Bihari violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Biharis_in_Bangladesh) by Bengalis in early March.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight#cite_note-11)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight#cite_note-12)Ordered by the central government in [West Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Pakistan), this was seen as the sequel to ""[Operation Blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Blitz&action=edit&redlink=1)"" which had been launched in November 1970. The original plan envisioned taking control of all of East Pakistan's major cities on 26 March, and then eliminating all Bengali opposition, political or military,[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight#cite_note-13) within one month. Pakistani President [Yahya Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Khan) at a conference in February 1971 said ""Kill three million of them and the rest will eat out of our hands.""[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight#cite_note-14) Prolonged Bengali resistance was not anticipated by the Pakistani military leaders.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight#cite_note-PDJ_1977_p2-15) The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major Bengali-held town in mid-May. The operation also precipitated the [1971 Bangladesh genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide), in which 300,000-3,000,000 civilians were killed and roughly 10 million refugees fled to [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India).[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight#cite_note-16)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight#cite_note-17) Bengali intelligentsia, academics and Hindus were targeted for the harshest treatment, with significant indiscriminate killing taking place.

[Edit: at the suggestion of u/abtam11, I am adding a link to a video that highlights some aspects of the bill. https://youtu.be/8l0wPyLQSDg]

Between Teen Talak, Chandrayan, nationwide floods, Article 370 and Economic crash most of you must not have noticed the National Medical Commission Bill (NMC) that was sneaked into the parliament and passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha recently. This bill that shakes the healthcare system of the country to the core (and not in a good way) was vehemently opposed by doctors all over India, by black bands, marches, burning copies of the bill and when all else failed, even strikes. Many even got arrested during the protests. Yet, it never even made it to the National news. And the bill passed with barely any opposition. So what is it, why doctors are protesting it and is it really that bad?

Let me save you a lot of time - YES! But that is my opinion. Please feel free to form your own opinion. I am attaching a copy of the bill so you can read it yourself if you want,

 [http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185\_2019\_LS\_Eng.pdf](http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185_2019_LS_Eng.pdf) 

Here are some of the points in the bill that I found very disturbing. 

# Legalization of quackery : 

First please understand that under the current system, students after clearing +2 medical undergo MBBS entrance exams through NEET. After clearing one of the most rigorous competitive exams in existence, they study under gruelling circumstances (in govt colleges and a handful of private colleges) for 4.5 years. The exams every year and after passing Final year MBBS, they have to do one more year of very hard training (internship). After that, they have to pass yet another exam called the NEET PG entrance exam to gain admission for MD/MS courses to become a specialist. Since the value of MBBS has greatly decreased, this has become a mainstream process for ost doctors across the country before practicing.

Also note that India has a massive shortage of doctors. According to **WHO, the doctor patient** ratio needs to be **1:1000.** Note that WHO specifies this for government Allopathic doctors. In India this ratio of government allopathic doctors is **1:10,189**. Which means that there is a massive **shortage** of doctors - amost **6 lakh** doctors in the country. This shortage is found in **both urban and rural areas** though the shortage in r**ural areas is more severe.** However, the urban areas are not doing that good either. This is especially when the entire rural population is also seeking healthcare in the urban areas due to **lack of basic facilities and infrastructure** in the rural areas. These deficiencies would not allow for much healthcare provision even if doctors were there.

Also, note that according to WHO standards, India **lacks 2 million nurses** as well. WHO has issued warnings to India regarding its dire state of healthcare and the crisis faced by the people. So the ""brilliant"" (massive sarcasm) solution is this NMC bill was Community Healthcare Providers. We already have a similar system of ANM's that kind of fit the description, so why is this a problem.

The problem lies in the **language of the bill** which is **very vague**.  It states that ""Any person connected to the allopathic heathcare system"" can provide ""primary and preventive healthcare"" ""for a limited period of time""  after a ""6 month training program"". They can work without supervision here. However, under secondary and tertiary hospitals, they will have to work under doctor's suprvision.

Look at the statements in quotes. What does **""any person connected to allopathic healthcare""** mean? Can an ambulance driver get this accredition? Can a ward boy get it? The bill makes no specification. It does not specify the minimum qualification needed for the course. (I could be wrong but I did not find any description). It does not state any experience required or previous job status - nothing.

next it talks about a **6-month training** program. Again, training for what? What courses will be included, What these people will be trained in. How they will be trained. Nothing is specified.

Next it talks about providing **primary healthcare**. From what I understand. Primary healthcare means the treatment one gets at the first point of contact with the healthcare system. Generally, In sane countries where stuff like people's health is important, this means a contact with GP - a general practitioner or physician that can provide basic treatment for basic things. But In a country like India where ""Superpeciality Hospitals"" are the first point of contact for people, the lines between primary and tertiary level healthcare are blurred. **The bill does not define what Primary and Preventive medicine mean**. It is not understood or implied because as I said, anything can be considered primary when given at first point of contact with healthcare. So what treatment can the Community healthcare providers provide? Can they write cardio medications? Can they write pediatric medications? Note that even MBBS students cannot write super specialty treatments or even a head CT to look for brain problems unless under supervision. Even PG students (3 more years after MBBS and internship which makes them a specialist) cannot fiddle with other departments' treatment. And for good reason - the medication and treatment is way more complicated than making a Chandrayan rocket. SO can these people write that? Can they perform operations, which MBBS students cannot do unsupervised? Even PG and beyond need supervision. 

Doctors are strictly regulated when it comes to ultrasound to prevent sex determination and female feticides. (I am not trying to open a debate about whether that is good or bad. Doctors, please focus on the issue at hand) What is the guarantee that these people will not just determine the sex? 

Again, these people are supposed to be practicing in rural areas. There is **no mechanism to make sure** that they will actually **practice in rural areas** and not just peddle pills in urban areas. 

Also, while doctors are bound to write generics and single-dose combinations, there are **zero regulations** in place for these Community Healthcare providers. (CHP) How is this in line with the intention to decrease unregulated indiscriminate use of drugs?

Also, how much time is ""limited period of time""? 3 months, 1 year, 10 years. 100 years? Nothing is specified. Even doctors have to renew their registration every 3 years.

Already people illegally practice allopathy and kill so many people and give them lifelong problems. The govt has claimed to ""stop all quackery"" with this bill. Well yeah, this is one way of doing it. Legalize quackery so there won't be any quacks left. Note that the reports of how well these CHP's do are mostly self-reported and up to now have been for things like uncomplicated delivery and diarrhea. If you talk to doctors they will tell you that in uncomplicated deliveries (which form a large chunk of the deliveries) you have to just catch the baby. The baby and the mother do all the hard work for you. In many cases of bleeding, a simple massage can help stop it. So that is not a very complicated thing to be entrusting to the community. However, comparing that to all primary healthcare is very wrong.

Now, note that doctors are **not opposed** to the idea of community health practitioners **in principle**. Like I said ANM's already exist. However, how the system is set up and managed is the issue. Something more sensible would be welcome. For example. 6-month training program for a nurse with more than 7 years work experience in an MCI approved medical college/hospital specifically to help prevent Acute Encephalitis Syndrome and provide aftercare once the kid has been discharged from the medical college. The appointment should be for 3 years pending renewal and the power to practise should be void outside the specified areas. Add to that some basic management like ORS for diarrhoea, basic hygiene education, women's health education, checking BP, temperature or changing dressings etc (which nurses already do in most hospitals). However, management should be according to doctor's prescription and on any changes immediate referral and contact with the doctor. I don't think many doctors would be opposed to that form of a system. However, this vague wildfire like scenario is extremely scary.

Regarding **no** **supervision** \- why would anyone want to work under supervision when they can work unregulated alone? This will take away nurses etc from the hospitals. As I already mentioned that there is a massive shortage of them, the conditions in hospitals will become even worse as more and more of the nurses (and other professionals or non-professionals) set out to practice legalized quackery. This system should be started after ensuring an increase in the existing personnel, not just redirecting them.

If you want **more rural practitioners**, research has shown that the best way is to **make the system more inclusive** of people born and brought up in rural areas. The medical profession in India is barely in the reach of urban lower middle-class families. Rural population cal only dream of becoming doctors, here in such an exclusive system. But more on that later.

Also, for the people who cite **WHO recommendation for CHP**? - Note that WHO stated this for **very poor countries** that cannot train doctors due to complete lack of funds or war etc. They also stated that this is **highly dependent on the kind of training** received by the workers and care should be taken to ensure proper training for the work. Many countries much much poorer than India have managed a much better healthcare system without the use of these things. In India ( the 7th largest economy set to be a ""5 trillion dollar economy"" (ahem, ahem), what sense does it make to adopt measures for very poor and war-torn countries when we can afford better systems. 

The only sense I can make of it is that it will allow the govt to artificially inflate the numbers on the paper and say that they doubled or trebled the number of ""allopathic"" healthcare providers without having lift a finger. The situation on the ground will not change and might even become worse.

&#x200B;

# 2. The Bridge Course 

The notorious bridge course is back. This allows AYUSH practitioners to practice allopathy after a 6-month ""bridge course"". This is also ridiculous. Note that Ayurveda, Unani, Siddhi and Homeopathy are very different from allopathy. 6 months is not sufficient to learn the materials MBBS doctors find it hard to grasp in 5-8 years. It is hard and a lot of clinical time is required to gain the skills (yes even the meager skills of the doctors these days). That cannot happen in 6 months. This would be like asking a history PhD to build a nuclear reactor. History professor may have a PhD but it is not in physics. similarly, AYUSH is not the same as allopathy. Just as I would not want allopathy people practicing AYUSH. Now, I am not saying Ayurveda is not helpful or good. It is and should be allowed to flourish and thrive (don't get me started on homeopathy. I feel and this is my personal opinion, it is absolute garbage. But to each their own). However, I do believe that these practices should be kept separate and should not be allowed to mix.

AYUSH practitioners practicing allopathy, performing unauthorized surgeries and even running ICU's is a big reason for the poor healthcare, especially critical healthcare in the country.

While we should be investing in training Trauma surgeons, intensivists for better emergency management and taking of the massive work burden off of the specialists so they can focus on OPD's we are legalizing quackery. Training paramedics and issuing proper well-equipped ambulances would be a much better use of resources, help massively in cutting down the number of deaths and even stimulate the automobile industry. But no. 

If we really wanted to eliminate quackery, we would have one national database for registration of doctors. The doctor's name, place of work and registration number would be available for people to see. Anyone could type that in and check whether the doctor is an actual licensd practitioner or not. Would not be that hard. 

However, as was said in the Parliamentary discussion "" **The content of the bill is directly opposed to the stated intent of the bill"".**

# 3. The Very Misunderstood NEXT exam.

A lot of people think that NEXT exam is a good thing and will improve the clinical skills of doctors because that is what the Anti-Health Minister Harshvardhan Sinha stated. However, this is a pure recipe to **destroy all clinical skills** in medicine for good

Understad that currently every single yearly exam for MBBS (1st prof, 2nd prof, 3rd prof and 4th prof) is conducted by the university. The exams consist of theory regarding mostly the most common diseases found, practicals and clinical case discussion. Note that the object of the exam is to reject people unworthy of practicing medicine (I am obviously not including the donation and capitation seats and the completely useless medical colleges)

On the other hand, NEET PG entrance asks about questions that have very less clinical value and often about stuff that is rare and theoretical. The object is to rank students and select a handful out of thousands for future courses. Success is largely dependent on one's ability to take coaching and capacity to memorize MCQ's.

NEXT proposes to merge the two. These two exams are polar opposites of each other. One cannot satisfy both criteria. 

Now, if one says that NEXT will have clinical exams. Then that poses a massive problem for PG entrance. First, it is **nearly impossible to conduct clinical exams** at such a massive scale at the same time. Next, **clinical exams are subjective.** This subjectivity poses massive problems for **PG competition entrance** which should be objective, especially when there can be as many as 200 candidates at the difference of a fraction of a mark in the exam. Note that practical examiners are prone to **biases** and generally being one of the minorities, women, people from lower socioeconomic status, religion or someone not liking your face can cause you to fail because of their **discrimination**. Universities tend to protect agaist this to some degree. However, without any university to intervene, **scandals** in exams will become even more rampant than NEET. 

Note that this exam will be necessary to gain your degree. If an **MBBS student fails** this exam, they will be **equivalent to +2**. The bill makes no mention of how many attempts candidates get for this exam. By the looks of it, students can take this only once. Chances of failing are very high the first time especially when the exam is designed to reject the majority of the people. This will **destroy the careers of students for good**. This is devastating when you consider the amount of time and money spent by students for MBBS. Many students have taken **loans**. This makes no sense when **the difficulty of the exam has nothing to do with what actually it takes to become a good doctor.** Meanwhile, nurses, ward boys and AYush are having a gala time. Note the level of difficulty for MBBS doctors who actually study the required subjects and the ease with which non-MBBS people will have in order to practice the same management.

On the other hand, **if** one says that there will be **no clinical exam**, then this will **decimate the clinical skills of doctors completely**. Already MBBS students are found more in the coaching classes than with patients. Why would anyone go to clinics?

Moreover, note that the **final year MBBS has 6-7 subjects**. While **PG entrance has 19 subjects**. If one says that only final year MBBS subjects will come in the exam, then how does one justify admission into non-final year subjects (MBBS teaches stuff like microbiology in 2nd year. However, PG is gained in microbiology only after clearing PG entrance.) Also, an overall knowledge of all subjects is required to become a good doctor, Preclinical knowledge (non final year subjects) is as important as clinical. This was precisely why just 2 years ago the govt proposed ro make it compulsory to pass (gain at least 50 percentile) in the NEET PG entrance exam to even practice as an MBBS doctor. That kind of a reform would make more sense. ( I am not here to  debate how NEET is not Clean, focus doctors, focus). To take admission in an engineering college one must have studied maths in +2. One does not get admission based on class 9th marks of maths while they have studied History and arts in +2.  Then why is PG entrance allowing for this?

On the other hand, final year degree examination (similar to 10th exam or passing +2 which can be done in any subject) comprises of only final year subjects. So if one follows the PG entrance pattern, how does one justify making someone study ALL the subjects?

The cherry on the cake is that all this has been done **without standardizing the medical syllabus.** So different universities have variations in what they teach. This is what allows some universities to be awesome, like AIIMS and PGI or even the whole state of Tamil Nadu's awesome colleges. But it also allows some colleges to be absolute garbage. However, since the universities have their own exams, the students have to qualify them based on what they learned. If one wants to conduct one exam, it is imperative that the syllabus and the books be standardized. Else it will not be fair. It would be like studying the table of 2 and being asked about the constitution of India. It makes no sense. We have already seen how badly NEET has affected TN and its medical education system. That will be the story for the whole country

[Edit: Moreover, it seems like it eliminates internship. Understand that Medical students need to pass 4th prof to do internship. They do internship and then take NEET as an Exit test to qualify and practice. Internship is the most important thing in the entire career of a doctor to gain clinical skills and get an all-round knowledge of healthcare. That is one year in between the final year and the NEET entrance. However, the bill has combined those two exams one year apart into one and nothing has been mentioned in the bill as to what will happen to the internship.] 

This will promote **coaching culture.** Coaching is the **termite** that has hollowed out the medical system in India. IMO, this poison should be exterminated for good. However, this bill gives it more power. Already if one has not taken coaching in a metropolitan or sub metropolitan city, cannot afford coaching or is rejected by coaching institutes or cannot access them, they have **very low chances** of getting into MBBS or PG entrance (unless you ave backchannels through dalals. But most of them work through coaching institutes anyway). Now, these students **will not even be able to gain a degree**. They will not be able to practice even as MBBS doctors. All the while, CHP can practice medicine after a 6-month course! If your intent is to increase the doctor-patient ratio, how does this make any sense?

# 4. Reservation for the rich

ote that Medical colleges, both for MBBS and PG, have ""regulated and unregulated seats"". Regulated seats are where the fees is regulated by the government. They are affordable for even lower middle income groups. The unregulated seats charge amounts that only the very rich can afford, (no, even upper middle class cannot usually afford it) The Anti health minister claimed that the NMC bill will regulate 50% seats. Sounds great. But it isn't. When you look at the current system, the central government and the state governments together regulate 75-85% of the seats. This is a net **drop from 85% to 50% in the affordable regulated seats.** The increase in unregulated seats has been called reservation for the rich as **universities decrease the minimum marks required for admission to accommodate students that pay more at the expense of more deserving candidates.** Medical education is slowly becoming less and less accessible to the common man. Note that the **less the access of medical education to the common man, the less is the access of healthcare to the common man.**

This is obviously to put more money in the pockets of the politicians and their cronies that own so many medical colleges across the country.

# 5. National Medical Omission Bill

Note that until now, there is a **set method** of maintaining **medical colleges**. There are **strict requirements** to open a medical college, maintain one (keep one open), to increase the available seats for students, etc. It makes sense because medical colleges **treat people and train future doctors**. It is imperative they have proper requirements to do so. For eg, one cannot become a surgeon is there is not an operation theatre (or enough tables in the operating theatre for students to learn on). Until now, this regulation was done by the MCI or the medical council of India.

Yes, the same one. However, recently MCU has been **closing down many medical colleges** across the country , even government colleges, as **the government has not provided appropriate funds to maintain the infrastructure.** I am not even going to start with private medical colleges (not talking about the few awesome ones) While the govt likes to brag about ""creation"" of new seats in medical colleges, they conveniently forget the seats lost due to lack of upkeep of existing medical colleges. Just **last year** about 2000 seats were created and about 3000 seats were lost. There was a **net loss of about 1000 medical seats.** But instead of spending money on the colleges, the govt decided to eliminate the body that shut down incompetent medical colleges. 

Now the colleges **do not need to be inspected. Inspection is optional and can be done after 4 years of the opening of medical college** \- at the time the first medical batch passes. What is to stop you or me from opening a **Trump University** like medical college, charge lakhs of rupees per student per year and then close the college after 3 years and then open another one? Absolutely nothing. This will destroy the careers of thousands of students per year. This will destroy their homes and lives (remember how much money these colleges will charge). Students will pay the fees, join coaching, and study and due to no fault of them, they will be left with no degree. Just like with generics, for medical colleges, there will be **no pragmatic way to tell reliable and unreliable ones apart** (except for a few ones). This is l**egalized conmaship. (420si)** Not to mention the money laundering hubs these paces will become.

Note that the old MCI head was in trouble for taking money to allow some sub-par medical colleges to function. So the solution is to remove ALL regulation from ALL medical colleges. What a cognitive dissonance sir jee.

This truly is the National Medical Omission Bill.

# 6. No more AIIMS, PGI?

Well,techncally they will still exist. You must know that AIIMS, PGI, JIPMER like institutes enjoy a **fairly autonomous status** and the **government** is **not able to interfere** in their working by and large. Correct me if I am wrong, but NMC bill **removes this autonomous status.** This autonomous status plays a great part in making these colleges hubs of learning and research, incredible studies and **institutes of excellence.** This will be a massive blow to their functioning and will reflect in the quality of their care and research. I have no explanation as to why the govt would want to do this.

Another point is that these institutes have PG exams twice a year. However, under NEXT, that will be reduced to once a year. This will cause droppers to lose an entire year instead of months. 

# 7. Replacing MCI with worse.

So we have all heard about the corruption stories of MCI. No one is defending the MCI here. However, this bill does away with the MCI and replaces it with the national Medical commission. This will consist of all government appointees so they will be pretty much like Niti Ayog. What is amazing is that the **medical community gets nearly no representation** in the NMC. Ask yourselves about how much you know about the medical system and how it works (non-medicos obviously). That is exactly how much these people will know. And they are supposed to make decisions about medical education and healthcare. Imagine handing plutonium to a monkey. That would be safer.

Now, there has been many proposals to fix the MCI problem. I liked the one where MCI would be elected and the members would be on partial terms like Rajya Sabha. Their functions would be the same as the old MCI. To control the corruption, one could have ahd oversight by a National Health Comittee with represenation of govt and medical communty; Kind of how it works in Germany. This may not be the best solution but this is one of the scores of solution sthat were better than the NMC.

The state of economy that we see today will be the state of healthcare very soon because it will be managed by similar people.

&#x200B;

# 8. Barely any State Representation

The NMC has a structure where states get rotational representattion. Which means a **state**, especially smaller stated that need more **representation** will get a chance to be on the committee **after as much as 12 years**! After slight dissent from the (non) opposition, this rotation was changed so that states could get representation a little sooner, However, even that is pretty vague. So obviouly state interests are not protected.

&#x200B;

# 9. Too much power

The NMC has too much power. Even **MCI** inspected the colleges and provided guidelines over the medical syllabus, it **did not fix fees, decide new branches** unilaterally **or have complete control over exams**. NMC has all that and more. **The definition of the powers and purpose is so vague that it is meaningless.** They could do anything and it would be binding. 

Moreover,  **the decision of the center in all matters is final.**  so the center could issue a fatwah on anything in complete opposition of the opinion of the entire medical community, all the states, all professions involved (like this bill) and everyone will have to follow it no matter how senseless or harmful. This is total dictatorship and seeing the past few decisions regarding healthcare, will be devastating!

&#x200B;

These are just some of the most important problems I saw at first glance. As I learn more about this. I will keep you posted. I thought everyone should know about these problems as each of these directly affects your healthcare. The politician will fly to USA at taxpayer money for their treatment. We will have to suffer the consequences. If you are outraged by this, please spread the word. Contact the media and ask them to cover this.

or write an email to the PMO, tweet at Harshvardhan / PMO, or just irritate your representative till the goats come home. Most importantly, inform as many people as you can about this. This is our fight."," Thank you so much for writing this!

It's sad that most people don't care about how this NMC bill is directly going to affect health services. Doctors are definitely affected by this bill especially future doctors but this bill is going to affect the common public the worst. It's sad that there's no provision on security/protection of doctors against workplace violence which is extremely common in India.

I doubt that anyone would care enough to email these channels. Even if they do, there's a reason most channels are quiet. The government doesn't want people to know that they're privatising healthcare and people will be treated by quacks. The massive protests all around by us were not even given adequate coverage by media. It's tragic that people don't seem to give a fuck about their basic rights. As per a 2016 WHO report on the health workforce in India,  57.3% of those practising allopathic medicine did not have any medical qualification. Nothing is being done to address that issue. A fascinating and honestly scary read.

I believe our democracy will never lift itself unless we establish dialogue between the voters and the lawmakers. Lawmakers have no idea what we want, nor what we need. They have random ideas and they indiscriminately run with it. Not one developed country recognizes Homeopathy and considers it as alternative medicine (quackery for the lack of a better word)  but we have a ministry for it. Speaks volumes where we are a country are going. In general, in the area of policy, something cannot be defeated by nothing. Something can be defeated only by something else. If the current situation is unbearable, and somebody proposes some (possibly flawed) action X as a solution, then those saying that lets not do anything because X is bad, will always be defeated by those that say that the current situation is so bad that something needs to be done. Bureaucrats and ministers want to do (and be seen as doing) something, and in the absence of other ready options, they will go with X.

This situation obtains in the area of medicine. The situation of healthcare in the country is horrible if you are not urban/educated/well-off. The previous system, MCI, which was essentially doctors regulating themselves, was extremely bad. Corruption was sky-high - MCI was most likely the most openly corrupt institution in all of India. It was ineffective in ensuring large numbers of high-quality doctors, in regulating the conduct of doctors, and holding doctors accountable for malpractice. Given the current situation is so bad, and in the absence of other solutions, there is no surprise that the new NMC bill received political support, especially since it will benefit politicians even further.

If the people who oppose it are serious, then they need to put forward compelling alternatives. By which I mean, they should understand the other perspectives, and they should put forward a new proposal (which should go to the extent of including a draft bill), so that the NMC bill can be replaced. This is the only way ahead for them, but this represents a lot of work, so it is easier to write articles in newspapers and posts on reddit.

I have [engaged with this issue earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ct4b8i/national_medical_commission_bill/exjvm0p), but apparently I am an ""IT Cell"" guy, and so, conveniently, these issues don't need to be engaged with. Oh well. Thank you for talking about this.. I made 3 posts about this but nobody cared.. it's too late now though >After that they have to pass yet another exam called the NEET PG entrance exam to even be able to practice as an MBBS doctor.

Currently they don't have to pass neet pg to be called doctors. You can practice as an MBBS doctor without clearing neet pg.

Another point which will actually decrease the rural doctor population under this bill is.. currently all state governments give extra marks in NEET PG exam upto 10% per year of rural service, this incentivises doctors to seek postings in remote areas, however under this bill there is no mention of that, so most MBBS graduates will stay at home to prepare for the exit exam since WITHOUT CLEARING IT THEY CANT BECOME DOCTORS It's hard to have a healthcare system for a billion people with only 1.4% of GDP devoted to it. And we all know, that that 1.4% is more effectively ≈1%, thanks to corruption. I appreciate your efforts. But this needs 6 separate threads. > Many countries much much poorer than India have managed a much better healthcare system without the use of these things. In India ( the 7th largest economy set to be a ""5 trillion dollar economy"" (ahem, ahem), what sense does it make to adopt measures for very poor and war-torn countries when we can afford better systems.

Look at GDP per capita, not GDP total. India's numbers for hospitals, nurses, doctors and other medical practitioners are also great when you look at them like raw numbers. By GDP per capita we are poor and worse then war torn countries like Iraq. My parents are doctors and they were of the opinion that the protests held by doctors lacked propagating awareness among the people about the NMC bill and how it is harmful for the future. A major strike was planned in Maharashtra around 8th August before the bill was signed by the President. The local doctors had planned on making posters to educate people about the effects of the NMC bill and planned on displaying it outside their hospitals. But because many cities were troubled by the floods in the state, the strikes were cancelled. Moreover, the media was focused on reporting about the Article 370 revocation and floods and would have sidestepped these protests. However, [Manish Tiwari raised many points in the Lok Sabha about the many fallacies in the bill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l0wPyLQSDg). OP you could link this video in the description so people who don't want to read the whole thing can refer to it. [removed] >The bill does not define what Primary and Preventive medicine mean.  

There are 3 levels of healthcare: Primary, secondary and tertiary. And there are 4 levels of prevention: Primordial, primary, secondary and tertiary. It's pretty well defined in a community medicine book.

>2. The Bridge Course. 

I don't see anywhere where the bill mentions this. High effort post, will share this! Then what is the solution for severe shortage of medical practitioner in rural areas./urban slums


Even now , I have observed that bhms and bams guys setup their clinics in rural areas or urban slums as they know that an educated person will never visit their clinic in well off areas.
They keep their fees low like 50/100 RS compared to what an MBBS would charge 200/300 RS ., 
MBBS- MD Doctors aren't interested to serve in rural / slum areas as the chances of making big bucks is very miniscule there.

I don't think it will make much of a difference ,since the exit test is same for everyone ,it will ensure that the quacks are ateast knowledgeable in dealing with primary healthcare. I don't think you know the ground realities of the health care sector and you are just going by what is written. The things which are not clearly defined as you say will be decided the body which is being formed. There is a hierarchy. Laws, rules  and regulations. Only law has been framed. Rules and Regulations will be framed later.  

The previous system heavily favoured the rich. Even the students who couldn't obtain passing marks used to get mbbs seats as certain percentage were reserved for high paying students. Now it has been changed so that they first need to qualify before buying their seats. It also helps government in increasing the medical seats . Your article is very informative, and also slightly misleading in a few areas.   


**Point 1 & 2**: Very well written, it is obviously stupid to allow anyone to practice on the same level as an MBBS graduate, irrespective of circumstances. Medicine is no joke and can kill people.

I believe it is a very good step forward that they want to create more community health practitioners with the bridge course, but they need to be regulated, like restricted to rural or tier 3 cities where these is actual lack of healthcare.  


**Point 3:** I find this misleading. Doctors were enjoying a free pass, so they are obviously outraged towards a regulating exam. (We were having it easy, it should stay easy attitude).  


All the major countries in the world have a proper exit exam. USMLE/ PLAB/AMC/Approbationsordnung für Ärzte/  аттестации, all of them are centrally regulated and a portal for entrance into PG.  
Like you said, this exam is not to doubt the integrity of good students or students of Gov. colleges who have studied well, but to regulate students who got admission through underhanded means and got a degree by bribes.   


Also, your concern about how 1 marks will create a difference, yes, it will. But the NEXT exam proposes a cutoff mark for ***QUALIFICATION*** and a merit score for ***SELECTION.***  

 It means that you will have to score a minimum set mark for getting your license but the same marks will be used to create a merit list from where you will be selected for post graduation.

Point 4 & 5: The reality is, there is much more to opening a medial college than putting a board up stating that it is. Private hospitals maybe unwilling to turn themselves into a medical college unless they see profits. 

I am not saying that these are good things, rather these are pretty bad signs for healthcare of any country. But, the issue here is that you cannot do anything about it. It also doesn't help that most of the hospitals are owned by politicians & friends.  
The only rainbow here is that institutes can take any amount of money, but their students will still need to pass the NEXT exam. 

  
Point 6: AIIMS and PGI are premier institutes. They will still be. Because the top cream of the students will be selected by those colleges.   


Also a few more points that need to be added,   
1) NEXT will also serve as a licensing exam for any student who graduates outside India.  


2) I feel like you started out writing such a great article but it soon turned into a rant. (It's just what I felt because a properly curated article does not use ""anti-health minister"" or that amount of sarcasm that you used). Additionally, you only pointed out the flaws... There were pretty points about the NMC bill too.  


3) Overall in conclusion,  
\*Bridge course is not bad, but it needs to be regulated.  
\*NEXT is necessary, and should have been implemented long ago. It ensures uniformity and any student studying diligently will be easily able to pass the licensing cutoff, although making it to pg is a matter of hard work.  
\*More reservations and unregulated fees suck, but that is the necessary evil so that we get more medical seats in India.",2019-08-30 12:36:56

It was started by the people, I'm totally in favour of removing caste system but I mentioned removing caste based reservation because that is something that the government can change quite easily to something like an income based reservation. Additionally, I didn't mention everything in the post as I was in hurry and added an etc in the end. Please don't assume that I don't recognize caste system and that caste discrimination doesn't exist. It was just something that I didn't include in the title as it didn't strike me while making the post."," Ok let's get one thing straight

Dictatorship is not a good thing to happen. At first ur goals are ""need a strong leader""

A year later, dictator realises that

A. He has support

B. He has support from Army

C. He can manipulate Media and Courts

D. He can fuck with your life

Just ask Syria, Iraq, North Korea and Nazi Germany.

Dictatorship starts with something innocent but dictator has 0 interest in taking you into consideration once he had control Is this ur high school project? If one thing 20th century taught us, there is no benevolent dictator. Dictators are bad, all of them. 


How do u burn bodies in a river?  Reservation is a very good thing for the society and the economy, there is no need to remove it. It gives a leg up to the discriminated people and allows them to and more people joining the mainstream economy is good for the economy.

So, no, we dont need a dictator. Removal of caste based reservation? Funny how removal of caste system is not mentioned but removal of caste based reservation is. We are a dictatorship and things have only gotten worse. Yess in 100 years for sure No place can be perfect. Even in the most advanced economies or civilized, educated countries you see instances of racist behavior, religious overreach, and capitalist greed and corruption. Law is the same everywhere around the world; it's the enforcement that is lacking. 

I haven't heard shaming of parents who kill their child for the caste's honour, or tax evaders being named in national newspapers. Rich kids and violaters need to have their name appear in media. Politicians and their kin need to be under the scanner more than the common public. This needs to happen so that everyone afraid to fuck with the law, but not scared of the law enforcers like they are today.

What we need is to somehow dump extremely old cases pending in courts and dump them. This should free up courts to work on relevant stuff.

Dictatorship is not the answer. It will only worsen things. Jaha vote milenge waha policy jayegi Caste Based reservations are necessary.

They will be dissolved only when caste based discrimination stops. I don't care how much the castes were oppressed. Caste based reservation is still irrational and should be removed, along with any and all mention of castes. The entire concept should be eradicated. Is there reservation for blacks in u.s. to correct apartheid? 

Will it be possible? Very unlikely. Cultural change is required for all these.

For people to stop burning bodies in Ganga, they must be educated on what that does to Ganga in a way that the religious people will relate. Maybe have a movement where we show how purity of Ganga is violated my human actions. But it's a difficult topic.

For reservations, inter-caste marriages will solve this for sure. Once enough mixed caste people are there, none of it will make sense except income based reservations. For this to happen, we need to share stories of people who have intercaste marriage and normalize it. Remove all taboo from it. But it's difficult for rural people to accept this, they may need more work to get used to this. Wtf. Are you living in India or not. The current regime is the equivalent of dictatorship in a democratic country. Also known as majoritarian government.

If the current regime can't pull such thing what you think a dictator an Indian dictator will pull such a thing. I don't think it's going to be of any help because the people don't understand the rules and laws that are being foisted upon them. Even the people you are relying on to enforce these laws don't understand what they are about or why they are important. That's why nothing works. The rules and laws we are trying to live by come from the West and it is foolish to expect Indians to have any comprehension of them. There are only a tiny number of Indians who have gone through the requisite process of Westernisation that allows them to live by and enforce these laws. It is a part of their common sense. However, it is not a part of the common sense of Indians and in any society, the majority dominates and forces its will upon the recalcitrant minority. So, the only choice these Westernised Indians have is to secede and form their own nation-state and live by their own rules and regulations and leave the Indians to their own devices.",2019-08-25 23:03:33
Policy,What's happening in Srinagar that needs to be hidden?,cr0r4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cr0r4c/whats_happening_in_srinagar_that_needs_to_be/,"I was flying through Srinagar yesterday and an announcement was made on flight to keep the window shutters down both while landing and while taking off. I thought this was very odd, usually the instructions are to keep them open while landing and taking off. But it went further than that. Someone on the flight tried to open the shutter while taking off and the cabin crew almost flipped out, they made repeated announcements and then one of them actually walked up to make sure it was closed! I have never seen a crew member walking while take off!

I asked one of them later why these instructions, they shrugged it off and just said that they have these instructions from their superiors so I couldn't get much. 

Any one else had a similar experience? what's going on?"," This has been the policy for a while now. I flew into Srinagar in May and they also made us close the window shades while landing. They said it’s a government policy for security reasons. They are shifting Area 51 to Srinagar. The fed govt doesn't want you to know that This has been the norm since forever. Srinagar is a defence airport and not a mere civilian one. Hence the restrictions. 
There are quite a few Air Force helicopters and jets if you are actually able to get a glance. Same thing happened to me in march when I was flying out of Chandigarh airport. They asked us to roll down the shades when the plane was taxiing to the runway, tensions were high and probably Chandigarh airport is also a AF base and didn’t want people to look at the base This usually happens on airports that are also used by the air force. It may be that IAF aircraft too were present and active at the airport at that time along with civilian aircraft. Maybe military has setup camps around airport area.. and govt doesn't want to people to see where exactly they've setup, the number of men and the equipments they have. That is not kashmir specific. I think it has to do with airports which are nearby military bases. I fly  from and to pune quite often and i can recall a few times being asked to shut the window shutters while landing. That's not new though, the Srinagar airport also houses Air Force planes and the policy has always been to not allow photos to be taken of it. This policy of shutters down seems to be to prevent a bird's eye map of the airport from being taken. This will help in preventing Pakistan from knowing the Air Force's station layout and also might help prevent a terrorist attack because they don't know the internal layout of the place. The Srinagar airport is undergoing construction of new hangars and bunkers post Balakot. It was in the media some months back.

So it is done to avoid leak of close proximity pictures. Major reason is that Srinagar airport is also an airbase for the IAF. They don't want eyes on thier assets on the base. I think it's common practice for dual use airports with security concerns Happens at Chandigarh airport  too. Be careful not to start clicking photos near the taxiway else the security may ask you to delete them in front of them. They are very strict about it sometimes. It's a bloody airforce base. That's a rule unless stated otherwise. This is true for a lot of Airports in India that are also military air bases. If the airport is also used by IAF they want to hide troop operational details. This is not new. It is because of security reasons and not at all related to scrapping of Article 370. I remember this rule starting a few decades ago (Kargil war?) for civilian flights in and out of J&K. 

Civilian aircraft were being escorted in and out of J&K by fighter jets with countermeasures (Eg chaff and flares for missile defense). The reason to keep windows closed was so that passengers would not know of the numbers and types of aircraft in the escort and a secondary reason was to avoid panic and public concern. 

Maybe they still continue that practice. As other posters have pointed out, there are other dual use airports in India where this rule isn’t enforced, only in J&K. So the presence of Air Force aircraft on the ground isn’t the reason - it’s for the aircraft in the air. 

I could remember wrong though. This was the case when I went there 4 years ago. Why has everything got to be related to the present situation in kashmir ? Its just as if you want to believe something odd is happening in Kashmir. [deleted] 'Nothing to see here.. Just some good old democracy.' amazing. during take off and landing, windows need to be open because passengers are the only people on board who can actually see the engine. If there is a fire or smoke of some sort, only the passengers can view this and report to the pilots and staff. it is also why cabin lights are switched off so that you can see clearly outside.  


The indian government is putting aircraft in danger just to hide something. really sad. Dictatorship or worse fascism has crushed all the existing democracy! Kashmir is under seize! And all this to polarize the rest of India and plunder them, while also plunder the land of Kashmiris! You don’t know what’s happening in Kashmir? [deleted]",2019-08-16 17:06:10
Policy,"Hello Top Minds of R/india, Is the Indian economy being nokia-ed?",cz0ctb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cz0ctb/hello_top_minds_of_rindia_is_the_indian_economy/,"I am uncomfortable with the narrative that the bureaucrats and figureheads in the Indian government are clueless morons tanking our economy. Why can't it be the same thing Microsoft did to Nokia? Force a fire sale of Indian government assets. Maybe we are up for the biggest wealth transfer to the richest elite in this country since demonetization? Or am i wearing my tin foil hat a little too tight?

Edit: Spelling"," One of the biggest reasons for this slowdown is the death of private consumption. It was the only wheel that was sustaining the economy. Now with rural consumption taking a hit, the government is clueless. To revive demand it needs to pump that RBI surplus as development expenditure, but it risks increasing the inflation. With lower income rates and if inflation rises the government is on for a disaster.
Long story short, the government is walking on fire. Why not both? Their cluelessness contributed to the current slowdown, but they are also corrupt enough to use this opportunity to transfer Air India etc to Adani et al for cheap.

Also privatization does not have to be the government's brain child. It could simply be the government's friends seeing an opportunity and them 'convincing' the government. > Force a fire sale of Indian government assets.

This is a good rationale actually. Keep the tinfoil hat, we'll see more patterns like this. I am more interested in knowing what microsoft did to Nokia? It will happen. There are a lot of PSUs that the govt wants to rid of, but who will buy it when the buyers themselves are in a slump? 1) Global recession was long forecasted for 2020 
2) We failed to capitalise opportunity to get business from China 
3) Indian economy rested on what we call ""black money"" , addition of cluster mess which we call gst further compounded it, lack of government trust, and dynamic policies and if that was not enough the accumulation of money from middle class to elite few who won't invest leads to the perfect concoction to kick down our economy. Don't forget recession is part of economy cycle. 

Probable future :We should expect deflation of economy which will lead to lower product costs but also more job losses. 

Possible but unlikely: Govt may decrease interest rate in favor of inflation, now do remember most people use interest as investment option and they may get fked , but I don't see it increasing borrowings. New minted currencies + deflation + lower currency exchange value against usd may lead us down to Zimbabwe root Inviting the top minds of r/India? 246000 replies coming up Damn right!

We were once the 3310 of world economy...sigh! In a free economy, people have choice to use either cash or electronic/ banking medium. Cash has its own positives and cons. Once printed, it goes through thousands of extra transactions with no extra significant cost. However, the electronic transactions charge per transaction. Both the system should compete, and people can choose. Cash shouldn’t be a dirty word. It's hard to predict as this recession seems to be a cyclic one, it's not just India but globally the investment is slowing. There are many factors that can be attributed to current downturn and for every industry there's a different reason. What I believe is that India in actuality never recovered well from 2008, while in fiscal terms we were out of recession very quickly this was in parts fuelled by the excessive lending during 2009-12 from various public/private sector banks.

Till 2013 coupled with High Crude oil prices economy loomed, around 2014 crude oil prices decreased but the effects of NPA's started kicking in economy. During the same time many big loans started converted to NPA's and the every single month the NPA's ballooned. 

In between the Central Government's implementation of GST and Demonetisation fractured a lot of domestic consumption, as a lot of it depended on Black money ( This is my personal opinion ).  The current government failed to control the NPA's till Q1 FY’19 when there was reduction of stocks of NPA's  by \~Rs.21,000 Cr. 

The government now has started to refinance these banks and merge them, although merging shouldn't have been a priority, while it wasn't a bad step per say. The surplus that Government skimmed from RBI a part of it might be used for PSB Recapitalisation which seems to be a good step, again it's hard to predict anything when it comes to economy its a dynamic system of scale that no one can comprehend.

Rich will always get richer, there's no problem in that. I believe the important issue is for the countries large population ( India )  is to deliver jobs and grow middle class. With a lot of manufacturing automation / automation it would be hard to grow a middle class ( again this is an assumption ) . At this stage it's very difficult to predict to what extent automation is going to affect the job market. 

Now coming to selling assets , may be or may be not. There's no singular answer. 

I think governments montenisation plans on non-core assets is fine, if some business / riches can get even more rich through clever understanding of Indian bureaucracy it's still not a bad deal , not atleast for an average tax paying Indian middle class citizen,  we won't have to shell out money for operations of various CPSEs that are a burden on our pockets. The biggest concern is how this government has a socialistic attitude for the poor and a capitalistic outtake for ultra-rich. There is a very little concern for middle class, anyhow this is nothing new. 

We need to stop relying on Central / State governments, as for our business rather than expecting government to provide incentive for domestic business ( like China does ) , a lot of our business have to grow Global ambitions rather than fixating ourselves on Indian domestic market. I don't think the toxic mix of bureaucrats who are selected through UPSC with questionable hiring process and Politicians will be mature enough to understand the dynamic global market. While it's an extremely painstaking process but I do see a lot of business growing in core engineering services in India ( from mobile transceivers, SDR to Custom ASIC's ) who are actually making a lot of money. Leaving aside fancy AI / ML ( essentially decorated statisticians ).   
There are huge opportunities in global markets, only if we have vision and risk taking aptitude. Our economy is not just and shouldn't solely depend on a immature Government structure.

Policy,What exactly went wrong with Indian economy under modi ?,cw51cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cw51cd/what_exactly_went_wrong_with_indian_economy_under/,"Most common things that I have heard are:

1- demonetization caused some irreversible damage about 2 years ago.

2- GST implementation was horrible. or taxes are too high.

3- privatization/ selling assets of  BSNL, air india etc. (I dont think anyone says this is one of the reasons, but just throwing it out there anyway)

&#x200B;

What else did they screw up in terms of budget / policy ? Can someone knowledgeable about this topic, shed some light ?

PS: I am not an expert. You can figure that out from the question itself ;)  Just trying to understand."," One thing you've missed out is IL &FS crisis. It was caused by corruption in corporate governance. No1 really knew how many subsidiaries were there under IL & FS. Since it was a systemically important NBFC it's fa affected the whole sector. This has led to liquidity crisis across the economy. * Bad exports policy. [Textile exports](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/indian-textile-sector-losing-edge-in-international-market-citi/article29184896.ece), [software exports](https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate/indias-software-exporters-may-lose-based-on-falling-incentives-and-rising-tax-rates/70743190). We are no longer able to compete with other nations in various sectors.
* High taxes on transactions. An example from the advertising industry is the [6% equalization levy](https://cleartax.in/s/equalisation-levy](https://cleartax.in/s/equalisation-levy) charged on online advertising expenditure (If you spend 100 rs. on ads on Google, Facebook, or any online advertising platform, you have to pay Rs. 6 on the ad spend, making it Rs. 106, an overhead of Rs. 6 on your business.). This has made Indian advertising businesses and businesses requiring online advertisement, incompetent in the international arena. If your expenditure is Rs. 100 on ads, you'll have to pay Rs. 6 as an overhead to the Indian govt as a levy, making the cost Rs. 106.
* Exorbitant GST rates on various services and goods.
* Ease of doing business has decreased due to increased filing requirements for corporations and small businesses.
* Quick to ban, but not quick enough to regulate. Example: Cryptocurrency ban by the RBI. 

There are many things this Govt. is doing right as well, such as increasing the minimum turnover required for a business to register on GST. However, a major policy overhaul is required to boost competitiveness against countries with relatively relaxed tax policies to bring foreign money into India. You covered GST but there's a structural flaw in GST, for example in automobile industry government taxes the highest rate in GST for every component in a car ( the products sub contract companies make) instead of the final product, and now the industry is not able to hit the gas pedal. Liquidity crunch in the market subsequent to tightening bank NPA %ages & demonitisation IMO.

Even genuine businesses suffered (while some biggies got all the needed support in terms of govt policy twists or deliberate oversight  e.g., Jio services, Green cover policy changes) due to this. 

This followed by the overall policy paralysis with all focus & attention on unwanted nationalism vibes is yet another cause according to me. Tax terrorism. Tax officials have been empowered to harass businesses for any small mistake made in tax filing. Case in point:  CCD Apart from everything else that others have mentioned, I believe untrained youth has something to do with this. Im and engineer. Literally 90% of my classmates, were unemployable as engineers after graduation. They had to be re-trained by their first employers. I assume the same/similar situation for other fields. This makes our younger populace less employable, less capable of leading in the global market. I have no proof, but a whole generation of such workers _must_ have some negative impact. Every time there's a crisis of faith, some new jingoistic thing is brought up to distract the the public. Just this year:

1. Look, we bombed an empty field in Pakistan and hundreds of imaginary terrorists died!
2. Look, we blew up a satellite!
3. Look, the PM is hiding in a temple cave! This is news and not election advertising!
4. Look, the PM is roughing it out in the wild! Don't mind that this photoshoot was too important to interrupt to deal with an actual terror attack!
5. Look, Kashmir is free because we removed the parts of the constitution that protected their freedom! No more rioting because everyone is under house arrest!

Meanwhile, press freedom is dropping, economic data is fudged, job losses are dismissed with a suggestion to sell pakoras, and now the RBI has been raided for money to spend on stimulating a dead economy. We're going into a recession and there will be more jingoism to distract everyone. Its a worldwide phenomenon. Not just in India. Lots of airlines are shutting down in Europe. In Dubai Banks are merging hotels and shopping mall outlets are shutting down. Even Hyatt is gone. DIFC's luxury shopping mall is supposed to have 200 shops. 175 are empty. Etihad has lost $4.8 billion dollars in 3 years. Hotels are vacant and realty has crashed. scores of CEOs have resigned.

Source: [Loy machedo videos] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI8E-oViEag). The answer to your question is quite literally in your question. It's just not 2014.

Read the lost decade by puja Mehra What do you think about Indian economy? What are rectifying areas? Is government is responsible for all these mess or something else need to be change?

According to me, it's not modi, It's us. If we, entrepreneurs,can  improve our buisness pattern, our methods then everything would get better.

Indian economy is towards a new morning.  We need to learn and improve. Why do people think that economical changes due to government’S fiscal policies happens in a short run? Indians have an issue of understanding economy and they blame the obvious ppl for that. 

GST is sooo good for India. India’s tax system previous to this was SHIT and hence there were SOOO MANY Tax evaders. I can see why most ppl are having trouble, cuz now they have to pay taxes. GST is used internationally and it’s doing just fine and helping the government do its job. 

- Accounting and Finance student in Canada. We use GST here (of Indian origin btw) Answer to your question is in your question.

Policy,Rahul Gandhi resigns as President of Congress,c8lydy,https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/i-am-no-longer-congress-president-affirms-rahul-gandhi20190703143743/,," This just might be the best thing to happen to Congress off late. And to Rahul Gandhi too. About time! No matter one's views, India deserves a strong  opposition. 

I'm not sure who should succeed him, but it should be a non-Gandhi who has done good work in their state and is preferably younger. Someone like Sachin Pilot? Here's the full resignation letter from Rahul Gandhi. 


>It is an honour for me to serve the Congress Party, whose values and ideals have served as the lifeblood of our beautiful nation. I owe the country and my organisation a debt of tremendous gratitude and love.

>As President of the Congress Party, I am responsible for the loss of the 2019 election. Accountability is critical for the future growth of our party. It is for this reason that I have resigned as Congress President.

>Rebuilding the party requires hard decisions and numerous people will have to be made accountable for the failure of 2019. It would be unjust to hold others accountable but ignore my own responsibility as President of the party.

>Many of my colleagues suggested that I nominate the next Congress President. While it is important for someone new to lead our party, it would not be correct for me to select that person. Ours is a party with a profound history and heritage, one of struggle and dignity that I deeply respect. It is woven into the fabric of India and I trust the party will make the best decision regarding who can lead us with courage, love and fidelity.

>Immediately after resigning, I suggested to my colleagues in the Congress Working Committee that the way forward would be to entrust a group of people with the task of beginning the search for a new President. I have empowered them to do so and committed my full support to this process and a smooth transition.

>My fight has never been a simple battle for political power. I have no hatred or anger towards the BJP but every living cell in my body instinctively resists their idea of India. This resistance arises because my being is permeated with an Indian idea that is and has always been in direct conflict with theirs. This is not a new battle; it has been waged on our soil for thousands of years. Where they see differences, I see similarity. Where they see hatred, I see love. What they fear, I embrace.

>This compassionate idea permeates the hearts of millions and millions of my beloved fellow citizens. It is this idea of India that we will now vehemently defend.

>The attack on our country and our cherished Constitution that is taking place is designed to destroy the fabric of our nation. In no way, shape or form am I stepping back from this fight. I am a loyal soldier of the Congress party and a devoted son of India and will continue to serve and protect her till my last breath.


>We fought a strong and dignified election. Our campaign was one of brotherhood, tolerance and respect for all of India’s people, religions and communities. I personally fought the Prime Minister, the RSS and the institutions they have captured with all my being. I fought because I love India. And I fought to defend the ideals India was built upon. At times, stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it. I have learned so much from the spirit and dedication of our workers and party members, men and women who have taught me about love and decency.

>A free and fair election requires the neutrality of a country’s institutions; an election cannot be fair without arbiters – a free press, an independent judiciary, and a transparent election commission that is objective and neutral. Nor can an election be free if one party has a complete monopoly on financial resources.

>We didn’t fight a political party in the 2019 election. Rather, we fought the entire machinery of the Indian state, every institution of which was marshalled against the opposition. It is now crystal clear that our once cherished institutional neutrality no longer exists in India.

>The stated objectives of the RSS, the capture of our country’s institutional structure, is now complete. Our democracy has been fundamentally weakened. There is a real danger that from now on, elections will go from being a determinant of India’s future to a mere ritual.

>This capture of power will result in unimaginable levels of violence and pain for India. Farmers, unemployed youngsters, women, tribals, Dalits and minorities are going to suffer the most. The impact on our economy and nation’s reputation will be devastating. The Prime Minister’s win does not negate the breadth of corruption allegations against him; no amount of money and propaganda can ever hide the light of the truth.

>The Indian nation must unite to reclaim and resuscitate our institutions. The instrument of this resuscitation will be the Congress party.

>To achieve this important task, the Congress Party must radically transform itself. Today the BJP is systematically crushing the voice of the Indian people. It is the duty of the Congress Party to defend these voices. India has never and will never be one voice. It is and always will be a symphony of voices. That is the true essence of Bharat Mata.


>Thank you to the thousands of Indians, both at home and abroad, who have sent me letters and messages of support. I will, of course, continue to fight for the ideals of the Congress Party with all my strength. I am available to the party whenever they require my services, input or advice. To those who support the Congress ideology, especially our dedicated and beloved karyakarta, I have absolute faith in our future and the utmost love for you. It is a habit in India that the powerful cling to power, no one sacrifices power. But we will not defeat our opponents without sacrificing the desire for power and fighting a deeper ideological battle. I was born a Congressman, this party has always been with me and is my life’s blood and forever that way it shall remain.

>Jai Hind. Lol. Party members are actually asking him to stay. ""After ages, I am free!"" Dibs on the seat. Have not been following Indian news much since the elections. Who could the next leader of the INC be? If he had done this before, they could have diluted the dynasty tag, at least in the literal sense. But Modi vs WHO? WHO ? WHO ?....now in Arnab's studio when he asks this question only sound will be ...crickets! Well if a male Gandhi heir resigns from politics it should be an indicator of a grim and dark future. Shashi Tharoor! His resignation letter
https://mobile.twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1146359704815194112 Tomorrow's news : party workers urge RG to take back his resignation.

This can continue forever. Longest resignation ever, has been going on for 3 months now. He will probably get re-hired once the clueless regional leaders start fighting each other. I guess we will all just ignore that Rahul setup that Congress data cell that basically fed them a bunch of bogus data and information which led to this poll debacle. BJP's 🌟 campanier is out. The power of marketing and pr can do, to finish off a guy forever. Seems like he is just fed up of politics , good  for him to resign. It will be interesting to see how congress will cope with the loss. No matter what people say i have utmost respect for Rahul Gandhi.....he never used crass words and never spew filth at other people and maintained his dignity throughout but alas that's just not indian politics i hope you best in life ahead. Huge loss to BJP! Time to appoint a puppet and pull the strings from behind without any accountability. Comes After 2months actually when he said he will.  Why So much of tantrum - could have been easily done. Not for long. He will courageously, efficiently and magnanimously return to save the party. He probably wants to take a long vacation before doing the come back. Just read the letter he wrote. The man has made so many valid points. https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/story/here-s-how-sonia-gandhi-replaced-sitaram-kesri-as-congress-president-1391491-2018-11-19

`


>Sonia Gandhi resisted all the pressure from ""the loyalist"" Congressmen to join the party. The Rao government was voted out in 1996. Sonia Gandhi did not campaign in the election. The BJP won 161 seats and the Congress got 140.

>Suddenly in the winters of 1997, Sonia Gandhi announced that she would campaign for the Congress party in Lok Sabha election due for March 1998. Sitaram Kesri was the Congress president at the time.

>The change in leadership equation in the Congress was swift.

>Sonia Gandhi joined the party in December 1997 at its plenary session in then Calcutta. She addressed her first election rally in Tamil Nadu, the state where Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated.

>In January, Sitaram Kesri welcomed the decision by Sonia Gandhi to join the Congress and campaign for the party in an interview with India Today.

>Sitaram Kesri said, [""Sonia has come as a savior.""](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/interview/story/19980119-sonia-gandhi-has-come-as-a-saviour-sitaram-kesri-828188-1998-01-19) By that time it was clear that the Congress could only function under Sonia Gandhi. Demands were being made in the Congress party asking Sitaram Kesri to hand over the reins of the party to Sonia Gandhi.

>But Sitaram Kesri, then 82, wanted to hold on for some time. He had some support in the party but the ""rebel camp"" was in majority. The Congress Working Committee passed a resolution on March 14, 1998 asking Sitaram Kesri to step down as party president.

>The transfer of power in the Congress is often termed as the bloodless coup. It was dramatic and executed by the use of force.

>Sitaram Kesri was reportedly locked in a room in the Congress headquarters on the Akbar Road in New Delhi to prevent him from creating obstacles in Sonia Gandhi entering the office of the Congress president.

>With Sitaram Kesri locked, Sonia Gandhi entered the Congress headquarters triumphant with her supporters shouting slogans.` lol. good riddance. honestly. BJP supporters (crying): Amul Baby, please don't leave. How will we win without you? :D

&#x200B;

Seriously, Rahul and Sonia should now quit politics and leave. This is a golden opportunity for Congress to kick nepotism and dynasty politics out. If a proper new President is elected then maybe they can give the party credibility. If they elect a Gandhi-controlled robot, then the party will just sink further. This guy finally realised that politics is not his cup of tea. I don't hate him on a personal level, as he seems to be a nice person, but he is/was an absolute disaster as Congress President. Go and live a peaceful life, away from incessant hatred and bigotry. This is a land of wolves now. Permanent thailand citizen incoming India needs a reddit party. The strongest opposition! This is a perfect chance for a competent non gandhi women leader to lead a major party like congress. However unlikely it might be i think it will change our political sphere for good.

Edit: Downvoted for stating an opinion. Never change reddit. Oh, thank god! :) The greatest news you can hear. Hopefully now they can rebuild, with people who are much more competent than he was. We need a stronger opposition more than ever Finally! r/notmyjob Not GG Rahul Good for him. Thanks for the memories, Rahul. now, we can start focusing on a new face for the opposition. Best thing to happen to Rahul, Congress and also India cause you need a strong opposition. A one sided government isn't good for India. A fresh face will light the fire under BJP's ass and keep them on their toes. Finally He was never committed to it bye-bye congress, vultures are their way. About time, this is excellent news, India needs a strong opposition in the coming term, someone to question the government’s mistakes competently and not just say “CHOWKIDAR CHOR HAI” Great news. You are a nice person , politics didnt suit you... If I were in his place, I’d just get on the dating scene, try meeting to some Italian hotties and live the lake Como life Hoping for an Icelandic citizenship? Rahul stays or Rahul leaves, win-win for BJP. Baba will enjoy Iduki gold now... After being defeated so many times, BJP (or Bhartiya Jana Sangh) party presidents should have resigned. Did they? no, why are they forcing Rahul then? good riddance to a dumb ass,my only hope is that they dont appoint an old foggy to the post.

edit-they are considering Kharge!!.these idiots will never learn,kharge couldnt even win his safe seat.. He will come back from retirement just before the next lok sabha election I think there's a distinct possibility that a non-Gandhi led Congress will join the NDA by the next elections. RIP Aalu ~ Sona machine So is his Sister taking over? Great great news. Looking forward to lot of creative destruction happening in this party. Makes sense for him to take up the position when winds favour Congress. Priyanka or Sonia should take over. If not then someone faithful to the family can keep the seat warm till 2024. [deleted] This is just a load of bullshit. What is the use of him stepping down when the Congress is still remote controlled by Sonia Gandhi. If Rahul Gandhi steps down, the sycophantic bunch will go with Priyanka Gandhi. Congress is dead. Time for Bahujan parties to rise. Finally

https://www.jio.com/fiber/en-in/plans Heck even local providers such as excitel offers unlimited plans less than these rates.. no no for me. I guess they will be offering tv channels thru jio tv app which also consumes data I think. Typical Reliance *Jumla*:

Plan Speed: 100 Mbps (Unlimited)  
Plan Benefits: Unlimited high speed data for 30 days (500 GB + 250 GB extra).

Throw in a lot of ""Unlimited"" everywhere and it may fool many ... Don’t fall for the jio trap. Just don’t. Meh. My Airtel Fiber is better than this.
I get 100Mbps up/down and 500GB data + any left over data(which is usually in the 100-200GB range) from the last month. Plus they are paying for my Prime subscription this year + 3 months of Neflix(already over) all for 999/- a month. 

I thought Jio's entrance in the Broadband field might drive down the prices of other companies just like it happened in the telecom sector, but doesn't look like it 24 inch tv is even a consider worthy option for them? And they green lit the proposal to offer a SPEAKER?!? 🤨 No unlimited plans. Ambani must be kidding.

Now I am afraid of Ambani playing Machiavellian tricks and putting local broadband providers out of business. These guys provide unlimited data at a relatively lower prices.

Now that they are competitors of evil motabhai, I am afraid for their future.

Seriously asking, am I right to be worried? Or am I overreaching? Who wrote this article? All the speeds are written in MegaBytes per Second, which is very hard to believe. Are the FUP daily or monthly limits? The only plan worth considering is the Gold one. It will fulfill most basic needs, has a large FUP. I think most people wouldn't need more than the provided 750 GB of data anyway. 250 Mbps is a great speed to have . If you get free cable with the set-top box that's the icing on the cake but I understand that Jio TV won't have any of the Star Channels. Due to so much hype and now poor plans, this is not going to be well received by consumers. Even BSNLs Speed after FUP is 2 Mbps. Offering 1 Mbps is to make people pay for Additional Data.",2019-09-06 03:21:31
Policy,Who agrees with me that we need a new party that can agree on the ideologies of both left and the right,d1c08q,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d1c08q/who_agrees_with_me_that_we_need_a_new_party_that/,"I have been thinking about it for a while and what I can foresee, the right wing is going to reign supreme for a long time now. And the opposition, the left wing has crumbled down because of it's corrupted incompetency and bad leadership qualities of Rahul Gandhi. People have lost faith in the left and the craze of modi is justified. We can argue if he's a good politician or not but there's no doubt that he is a great politician. The right wing is pro-nationalist and nationalism can be used as a tool by some to invoke radicalism and eventually, fascism. I am not being paranoid but I am concerned this can be the case when I see media channels constantly spreading biased news and fake nationalism. I think a strong party of youth that does not get biased or lean towards a particular ideology but only works for the welfare of the people of India. The presence of some form of opposition is needed to dilute some of the extreme ideologies of right wing and the left wing is incapable to do that. But that's just my opinion."," From what I realise, the left-right system of government is not very well understood by the general public of India. 

I’m gonna give you 3 examples-

1. My father doesn’t like BJP and my mother just loves Modi and they’re mostly active in politics. But both of them have no idea about Left or Right .

2. I went to dinner at a friend’s house whose father is a member of BJP and he himself didn’t know his party was right leaning or what conservative meant. When I asked him about his policies he just told me some simple ones like water sanitation and nothing else (tbh it was all in fun and jest, I didn’t want him to feel attacked and he didn’t mind simple questions).

3. I’m in MBBS 3rd year and one of our teachers in Community Medicine is a modi fan and one day he legit mentioned that ‘BJP is liberal as we call it in America’ and went on to explain 2 party system in America with many mistakes (I need to pass so I didn’t say anything).

Truthfully the points you make are good but I don’t think India generally understands left-right or conservative-liberal. Most general population looks at how much a government did. This is where I think Indian politics differs from American. 

BJP’s biggest plus point that they have used these 8 years has been ‘Congress did nothing for 60 years, we did so much in 4’. And it worked. For better or worse Modi always knew the first step in solving a problem except most of the times he doesn’t know the second. 

We need a party with liberal values containing some policies from the other side but they need to be presentable as working. There is no difference between ideologies of the Congress and BJP and anyone else. There isn't much difference between economical policies of any political party in India. The implementation also depends on who is in charge how urgently they need to get it done. Each one only differs in the way they have carved out votes based on religion, caste, language, occupation etc.


Ideology is not an issue in a country's development but division of power is. The best growth and development this country has seen was during times of minority and coalition govts because they were forced to share the power. If anything we need a political party which will agree to share power with rest of the govt such as RBI, CBI and EC. I don't understand much about ideologies but the amount of effort you've put in, you've my full support AAP might be the solution I agree. I support subsidised healthcare and redistribution of land. On the other hand, I think loan waivers for corporations and farmers incentivise taking bad loans. As a person, why would I even want to pay back loans if the next government is just going to get rid of my liabilities?

I support enough taxation to get us free education and subsidised healthcare, but don't support ridiculous import taxes on electronics and other goods. I also want farmers to pay income tax like anyone else and not be forced to sell their producer at government sanctioned mandis only.

Consequently, my choice of parties is quite limited because it seems like all they want to do is promise freebies just to get elected. Really wish we had more rational economic policies. I don't think politicians can legally own any media house but if they do, that media house should be sealed right now! Would you agree with this description of left-wing/right-wing?

Some left-wing positions: healthcare and education should be taken care of by the state especially for the poor, higher taxes for the rich to pay for welfare programs, markets should be heavily regulated, personal freedoms (freedom of expression). 

Some right-wing positions: free markets with minimal or no regulation, low amount of taxation, social conservatism

&#x200B;

I agree with you when you say that we don't have a competent opposition today. Silencing criticism by calling it  ""anti-national"" is a dangerous trend.

Have you thought of voting for independent candidates or parties other INC/BJP, when they present a reasonably coherent and sensible manifesto? I did that in General Elections 2019: voted for an new party. They lost but secured the third highest number of votes in my Lok Sabha constituency, just behind the big two. Securing a large number of votes is a source of encouragement for the candidate/party. It tells them that they're manifesto appealed to a section of the voters. They might work harder during the next local/state/national elections.",2019-09-09 04:32:52

Wtf

First provide proper facilities ,  promote the spot , make it clean and more accessible , then the tourists will come on their own

> His term was set to end in April, 2020. 

> Sinh's wife Ameeta Sinh, who is the chairperson of the All India Professional Congress in UP, has also quit the Congress.

His political history:

> Singh had lent support to Sanjay Gandhi when that member of the Nehru-Gandhi family had chosen to contest the Amethi constituency in the elections of 1980. 


> However, Singh left the Gandhi-led Indian National Congress (INC) party in 1988 and joined Janata Dal, which was led by a relative of his first wife. 

> He later changed his allegiance to that of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections he won the Amethi constituency seat.

>  Although Singh stood again as the BJP candidate in the elections of 1999, on that occasion he was faced with a challenge from the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia, who played heavily on her family's contributions to the area. Singh lost.[6][8]

> He rejoined the INC in 2003, choosing to announce his move on the birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi.

> He gained a second term as a member of the lower house of the Parliament of India in the elections of 2009. Since that time, he has represented the Sultanpur constituency as a member of the INC.

Sidenote:

His personal life is a bit filmy too. He is married the widow of an Indian badminton champion Syed Modi, who was murdered under suspicious circumstances. Sanjay Sinh was chargesheet by the CBI but the case was later dropped. The aftermath is crazy as well:


> Shortly after being released for lack of evidence, Modi's widow, Ameeta, married her long-time lover, Sanjay Singh. This marriage received sensational reportage in the press and became front-page news in India. Sanjay Singh's wife, Garima Singh, read of the wedding in the newspapers and filed a case in court stating that she had never been divorced from her husband and praying that the court declare his second marriage invalid (due to bigamy) and order restitution of her conjugal rights. Investigation revealed that Sanjay Singh had obtained a decree of divorce by stating a wrong address as his wife's residence. He had given the address of one of his several houses for that purpose, although Garima had not lived in that house for many years.

My grandparents are farmers in Andhra Pradesh.
He harvest 25 acres of land. In the past decade itself, I have not seen a single rice crop being harvested properly. There are at a stage where even in rural areas they need to buy rice.

When there is a good crop, the prices are down. 
They sell at 25kgs for ₹600-800. While in Delhi I buy at ₹2500/-. I can't understand this gross miscalculation. Farmer isn't getting it and we as a consumer paying more than thrice of it.

Coming to Auto sector, ""Maruti"" doesn't produce world class products in India. Taking an example of Swift model. There are many differences in Indian version and overseas version. So, if the sales slump in domestic market they can't even push it to overseas. It's a high time for these companies to produce high quality products. 

This government doesn't even know basic economics. How will they? They don't have even one person who has a sound market knowledge.
Giving loans to people like Neerav Modi and making him flee. While giving a free hand to income tax officers.

Irony.

##Summary

This policy is easily the biggest change to the education system since the old policy came in. It is in many ways, entirely unrecognisable, while in many other ways, simply formalising what was informally already done.

The first and biggest change, is that primary education, from ages 3-6, is now a formal part of school education, and public school must offer this. The second change, what goes hand in hand, is the abolishing of the 10+2 system. In many ways, the 10+2 system completely ignored the way a student's mind developed, and thus made for a poor learning system. The new system is 5+3+3+4. These stages are as follows:

- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.

- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.

- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.

- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.

The new Foundational stage, is supposedly meant to be ""age fluid"". Your age does not matter, as long as you are within the age group 3-8. The Policy recommends that during the foundation stage there should be no textbook based education, and instead play based and activity based education. It also emphasises on introducing a variety of new ""stimuli"" to force children's brains to develop in a holistic manner. These stimuli include : music (classical or modern, both singing and listening), art (regional, national, sketching, etc.), literature (folk tales, literature from the region, and national quality authors, both modern and classical). This is a massive departure from the present system, and the new emphasis on arts, is excellent. To add to this, a new bilingual policy is introduced. Students who learn languages are shown to have much better cognitive abilities than those don't so the new system makes all students learn 2 languages right from the start. One of these has to be the mother tongue, in order to preserve it. The other language may vary by region and requirements. The three language policy remains, and will be better enforced. The final changes to the primary education, is the integration of ""anganwadis"" into schools, and shifting them from primarily health workers, to full scale trained teachers, satisfying the needs of the students. The NEP requires the full development of people-skills, through a variety of things like weekly assemblies and daily show-and-tells. This improves the speaking ability, something that IMO Indian students have historically been terrible at. New extras include group reading of stories, learning morality and ethics (along with a proper framework), puzzle solving of various types, etc. to make sure a child has a significantly better development. Students who fall behind are not left out, instead the teachers are required to identify and help them, as studies suggest that students who fall back early almost never recover.

The next ""Preparatory stage"" lays emphasis on shifting from a more informal style in the Foundation stage, to a more formal textbook oriented education, in the Middle stage. It is a bridge stage. Please not that the policy emphasises that any and all technical education *must* take place in the native language (mother tongue) first. This is because students who learn in their mother tongue have a noticeable advantage over those who learn in say English. The policy also has a very good write-up on why the emphasis on English has hurt India a lot. The preparatory stage also keeps this focus on arts, and expects students to fully develop other skills beyond the ""textbook education"". The policy also demands the abolishing of the so called ""co-curricular activities"" instead integrating them into the core curriculum. This makes things like PE, yoga, art, music, a core part of the education. It also requires that every student specialise in at least one of these subjects. Another new concept here is the selection of the best students to help the worst students. The best students are selected by the teacher, and then become part of a sort of ""national training system"".

The third stage is the ""Middle Stage"". By this time, the student's mind would have developed enough. It is now time to start the fully formal education. Subjects start splitting from generic versions into more detailed subjects (like science -> physics + chemistry + biology). Students at this point will slowly start to also learn technical subjects in English. The idea is that students will be able to think in their mother tongue (which has a lot of advantages), while being able to understand and present ideas in English.

The fourth, and final stage is the ""High Stage"". At this point, students have developed a lot. Their mind now starts thinking in ""the bigger picture"" mode, and they can start planning for the rest of their life. In order to support this, students are now allowed to freely select courses and specialise. They are still required to understand and complete art courses, as this is paramount to their abilities, regardless of the final courses they choose.

Some important courses that come over the 12 years include : course on ethics and morality, Indian languages and their history and regional literature.

The next major changes come to the school management system. Schools can now form ""complexes"". A complex is comprised of nearby schools, such that each complex as a whole offers all of the above stages. Complexes are then given funds and other resources, like teachers. These resources may then be split up among the schools as necessary. This is important, because some types of teachers are relatively rare, and thus it provides optimal utilisation of resources. Sometimes other resources like libraries may also be shared. The exact details of what is shared will vary depending of the schools and their locality (population density, and ""backwardness"" of the population).

Schools also get a new level of autonomy, that was previously missing. Teachers are allowed to be the final deciders on the courses, and how they will be taught.

In order to improve attendance, the schools will do a number of things. Depending on the area, buses may be provided. Roads will be redone, so that transport is easier. Older students will be provided with free bicycles. The mid day meals will also be extended to offer basic breakfast to students. Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools.

To reduce inequality is a primary goal of the new policy. In order to do this, each school complex will have committee overseeing the demographics, and why students aren't attending. Specific groups called out include Muslims (for unwillingness to attend), and women in general. The policy requires that people of all castes and religions be integrated into the schools. The teachers are also required to emphasise on equality, by preventing acts that discriminate (e.g. not allowing SC/STs to sit with ""upper caste students"", etc.). The schools are required to join with the community in eradicating inequality. They are required to talk with parents and try and change their behaviour. This could be the groundwork to eliminating the reservation system. The policy sets the target of 2030, by which the majority of the students will be ""equalised"", not by pulling down the richer and higher caste, but by pulling up the poorer and downtrodden. Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones. A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from Under Represented Groups.

The next set of changes are aimed at teachers. The primary aims are to improve teacher pay, and status in society. It recognises that teachers are already heavily burdened with a lot of work, so no government work may be offloaded onto teachers. They are also educated better, and stricter standards are set. Teachers are required to ""re-educate"" themselves by joining workshops, and the vertical mobility of teacher is to be improved. Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy.
Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers. Substandard stand-alone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible. New teachers will have to register with an authority, and then will be quickly shifted into a school complex, for integration with the schools as necessary.

The next major changes comes to the testing system. The new system will be run by the National Testing Agency (which was newly set up in 2017 for entrance exams). They will be conducting the tests, and the new tests will be more like aptitude tests.  They will de-emphasise rote learning, instead encouraging an understanding of the subject. The policy claims that by 2020, all schools will have internet connected computers. It thus pushes for some degree of digitisation, by allowing for continuous evaluation through computers. Board exams in 10th and 12th are no longer. Instead we have exams in 3rd, 5th and 8th, called Census exams. The idea is to reduce the importance of Board exams. Teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes.

This policy also paves the way for better recognition of ""top talent"" students. For e.g. if a student is really good in Math, then they will be attending special summer schools to improve their performance. As already mentioned, top students are also required to tutor the students who are have a hard time coping. There is also a new emphasis on Olympiads. This should improve India's ranks in international competitions.

The RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. The RTE act itself will have to be reviewed, as the policy notes.

As for private institutions, there has been some misinformation. Private institutions will have to undergo some changes to have a similar system, so that they too can reach out to all students. The main changes are how fees is regulated. Fees needs to be rationalised, and can't be arbitrarily high. Once set, fee increments must go inline with inflation and reasonable increases, as opposed to random increases. Schools are also now required by law to be non-profit, and must be verified regularly by submitting all of their financial details. Private schools are also prohibited from having the word ""public"" in their name. So be prepared to see a lot of name changes.

Schools will now also be accredited and regulated in a slightly more free manner. However, they are required to release all details to the public. A framework and guidelines for ensuring school safety and security of children will be developed, and will be made a part of the eligibility conditions for a school education institution for recognition and registration. Every principal and teacher will be made aware of the provisions of the relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, etc. relating to child rights, and what constitutes their violation, by including a module in the teachers’/principals’ education/training programmes and refresher courses. Self-learning online programmes on child rights will be developed for the benefit of students, teachers, and parents. Credible mechanisms for students to report breaches of their rights, and for appropriate actions to be taken against perpetrators, will be developed and implemented, in collaboration with local police. The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme will be integrated into the curriculum of schools in a phased manner. (please note that Adolescent Education Programme is not sex education).

Also, in addition to all this, alternative forms of schools like gurukulas, patashalas, and madrassas will be encouraged, as long as they follow a modernised syllabus and are fully transparent.

The first changes will be implemented by 2020, with most major changes being in place by 2022. The first benefits will be seen by 2025, and by 2030, we should have fully transitioned, with all benefits in place.

##Comparison With the Current System:

The existing system failed primarily in 2 ways: Languages were poorly integrated, and many schools did not even offer three languages, as the policy notes. Hindi speaking states and TN were the primary offenders. Now all students are required to learn languages as per the Three Language Formula. The other way the old system failed was in testing. NCF (2005) laid heavy focus on eliminating rote learning, and in introducing a system where discovery based education was encouraged. The 10th grade NCERT textbook for science is a testament to that. Yet the system failed, because tests only cared about how well a student could mug up and vomit arbitrary facts. The new policy does try to fix this, but how much will improve remains to be seen.

The other more minor ways in which it failed was the integration of ""extra curricular"" subjects. Many schools actually refused to teach these subjects, considering them a time waste. The new system makes them a core part of the education system, so there should be an improvement.

Please discuss, and if you have any doubts, feel free to ask.

##TL;DR:

1. Learning to learn

2. Mother tongue as primary language of learning

3. Focus on trilingual policy, with English no longer as primary language

4. Equality of all students

5. Arts, Sports, Music, literature, etc. are all now of primary importance, and each student has to specialise in one of these, in addition to courses of their choice

6. Digital Education

7. Freedom of choice in higher stage of education

8. Board exams removed in favour of more frequent ""census exams""

9. Testing now to focus on aptitude and understanding, with more frequent tests, a la CCE under CBSE

10. 10+2 eliminated in favour of 5+3+3+4, with full focus on primary (3-8 years) of education"," I envy the new generation. I'm feeling sooo jealous right now. This writeup is simply superb.

It the posts like this makes me visit R/india. Trust me - none of the media outlets I follow have even given me a hint of these changes. All I hear from them is Hindi Imposition. 

Thanks and Kudos to OP!! Hey OP! You're doing great work bro. Thanks for the tremendously helpful post. 

I'm curious if there are any reforms around higher education as well. Will look up the draft. Wish I could give you gold. I love your detailing both this post and the replies Awesome!! The policy is really disruptive. It completely overhauls the current Indian education system. It touches each and every aspect of child education be it technical, cultural, moral etc. If implemented properly, it would really go a long in ensuring holistic development of children.

One thing I specifically like about the draft is that they are treating educationn as a continuum, not in segments (like primary, secondary etc) like it is right now. Hey OP could you create a PDF of this and the credit so we can then distribute this too those who are not on Reddit. This is great work and I think it needs recognition. Aaah man...this is the revamp our Education System has needed for ages. I hope we are able to see the benefits soon if this system is implemented across the country. 

Am so jealous and at the same time happy for the future generations of India who won't have to mug up textbooks.

Hope we are able to find well qualified teachers who will be the backbone for such a system. The highlights from the document (page 1 to 198):

##Primary Education:

###Understanding:
- Primary education (between 3-6 years of age) is critical for student development. 85% of student development happens in this age, as concluded from studies conducted by NCERT (sample size = 30,000 kids) (referred to as ECCE : Early Childhood Care and Education)

- Students who fall behind early tend to remain so for the rest of their life. Thus ECCE is probably the most important education provided

- ECCE includes health and nutrition of mother and child, along with various emotional and cognitive stimuli, like talking, music, games, etc.

- Crucial self-help skills must be learnt, including most good habits

- Children under the age of 8 do not follow the linear education as prescribed in the current curriculum

- Supervised play based education is proposed.

- Proposal to make everything in education from ages 3-8 one pedagogical unit, called ""Foundational Stage""

- The [Anganwadis system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anganwadi) (under Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)) when well funded has been successful

- Anganwadis don't provide the required education that ECCE demands

- Private preschools largely act as literal pre-schools, simply adding more education

- Private preschools have high Pupil Teacher ratio (PTR) and the teachers generally lack the skills necessary fro quality ECCE education. Don't help in health aspects.

- Majority of Indian students lack ECCE, as verified through studies by Ambedkar University, Delhi.

- Thus art, music, literature, etc. all of which have been historically part of Indian ECCE must and will be added

- Recommendation : include ECCE in RTE

###Corrective actions:

- NCERT scope expansion to include ECCE

- New framework will include details on making cheap toys for quality stimulation of infants (0-3 years age). For 3-8 year old children will have flexible play, activity, discovery based learning, teaching numbers, alphabets, basic communication, etc. Engagement with music, art, literature from India's vast history, including emphasis on regional variety.

- Strengthen Anganwadi education system. At least one Anganwadi worker with full training in ECCE per Anganwadi.

- Co-locate Anganwadis with schools

- Build stand alone preschools in areas where Anganwadis and schools exist

- Since ECCE is equalising, districts with socio-economic disadvantages will get special attention

- No separation on age basis in ECCE. Students from age 3-8 only.

- All of this will shift to under the MHRD or be under MCWD

- New committees in each state including : Cognitive scientists, early childhood education experts, artists, and architects, to design spaces for ECCE education

- Physical infra will be safe and clean, along with access to all basic amenities

- State govt. responsible for making quality educators. Current educators will get 6 month training course

- Everyone need to understand importance of ECCE


##Foundational Literacy and Numeracy:

- Objective : By 2025, every student in Grade 5 and beyond has achieved foundational literacy and numeracy.

###Issue at hand:

- Numerous studies show that students who fall behind here are unable to catch up for years, show flat learning curves

- Large number of students who fall behind in school fall behind in the first weeks of grade 1

- Schooling in the early years also lays too little curricular emphasis on foundational literacy and numeracy and, in general, on the reading, writing, and speaking of languages and on mathematical ideas and thinking.

- Few teachers have the opportunity to be trained adequately for this

- Teacher deployment is an issue

- Nutrition is critical issue

- Impossible for teachers to fix situation. Needs full effort from teachers, parents, schools, policy makers, etc.

- Teachers will be pushed into ""backward areas"" ASAP

- Nutrition and health (including mental and physical) will be addressed

- Urgent national mission

- Expansion of midday meal programme: Both a nutritious breakfast (e.g. even just some milk and a banana) and a midday meal will be served to pre-primary and primary school students. 

###Corrective actions:

- Dedicated reading hours in math and literature for grades 1-3

- Dedicated language and mathematics week

- Regular language and math ""melas""

- Weekly math and language oriented assemblies

- Weekly activities in libraries, like story telling, theatre, group reading, etc.

- Explore connections between real and class math

- Workbooks on language and mathematics

- National Teacher’s Portal (DIKSHA) will have a special section of high quality resources on foundational literacy and numeracy. Sources from across the country

- National Tutors Programme (NTP) where the best performers in each school will be drawn in for up to five hours a week as tutors during the school for fellow (generally younger) students who need help.

- Remedial Instructional Aides Programme (RIAP) as a temporary 10-year project to draw instructors - especially women - from local communities to formally help students who have fallen behind and bring them back into the fold.

- Instructional Aides to be 12th graduates, or highest available from the region, and will be from local communities. ""Backward community"" IAs encouraged.

- Encouragement of large-scale community and volunteer involvement: ex-teachers, ex-service men, etc.

- Adaptive assessment scheme will be developed

- computer based adaptive assessment first in secondary education, then by 2023, for the rest

- Extra aides to teachers via smartphones, apps and other technology

- Grade 1 students get 3 month long ""school prep module"" to make them ready for school

- Increase parental participation as home environment is important for proper education

- Ensuring proper teacher deployment and teacher conditions, and a Pupil Teacher Ratio under 30 : 1 at every school

- Libraries across the country will increase and expand

- Social workers and counsellors to be hired to work in schools

##Reintegrating Dropouts and Ensuring Universal Access to Education:

- Objective: Achieve access and participation in free and compulsory quality school education for all children in the age group of 3-18 years by 2030.

- according to U-DISE data, the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in 2016-17 for Grades 1-5 was at 95.1%

- access to secondary schools and upper secondary schools remains a very serious issue.

- Socio-cultural and economic issues also play a significant role in dropout rates

- There also remain serious issues of **inadequate infrastructure and lack of safety.**

- students **do not find school interesting or useful.**

- Increasing the intake capacity of existing schools in areas where many students are out of school;

- Building new educational facilities in under-served or un-served locations;

- Consolidating existing stand-alone primary, upper primary, secondary, and higher secondary schools into composite schools

- Better transport facilities, like proper roads, and bicycles for older students, school buses, organised walking groups, paid walking escorts, etc.

- Free room and board facilities in the form of hostels will be built - matching the standard of Navodaya Vidyalayas, for schools with large number of students from far away areas

- Safety is core concern, especially for under-represented groups. Zero-tolerance policy towards breaches of child rights will be adopted to ensure physical and emotional safety of children.

- Transparent system to track attendance, and immediately enquire if students are absent

- Dropouts aged 15 and above, who have fallen too far behind or are nearly illiterate, will be given the alternative option to attend adult literacy programmes 

- To make it easier for both governments as well as non- governmental philanthropic organisations to build schools, to encourage local variations on account of culture, geography, and demographics, and to allow alternative models of education such as gurukulas, paathshaalas, madrasas, and home schooling, the RTE Act requirements for schools will be made substantially less restrictive.

- Extension of RTE to students in age group 14-18 (so students from ages 3-18 are covered in RTE) I'm heavily impressed by the draft if one doesn't talk of the language issue. Now let's hope that the implementation doesn't get fucked over.

Coming to the language policy, if the centre has so much problem with English, they should promote the 23 scheduled languages instead of only Hindi. The problems of giving English too much prominence will still stay, only Hindi replaces English. Rather, more focus should be given on bilingual education in English and the native language. In that way, no Indian community gets an unfair advantage/disadvantage because they happen to speak Hindi natively.  And if the government is so keen to promote Hindi, make it an elective in the 3rd language slot for people who don't speak Hindi natively. An overwhelming majority will end up picking Hindi anyway, because speaking Hindi has its advantages in India. Its imposition doesn't. Bilingual education will also ensure a smoother transition to higher education where the courses are usually taught in English only (for pragmatic reasons). ##Teachers

- Objective: Ensure that all students at all levels of school education are taught by passionate, motivated, highly qualified, professionally trained, and well equipped teachers.

**self note** page 113-117 detail the need and requirements of teachers, along with existing issues they face. Gives very important perspective.

- The harmful practice of excessive teacher transfers will be halted with immediate effect

- suitable NTA test scores in the corresponding subjects will also be taken into account for recruitment.

- a classroom demonstration or interview will become an integral part of teacher hiring

- teachers will often be hired to a school complex (conglomerate of nearby local schools) to ensure there are suffiient teachers for all subjects

- schools and/or school complexes will be permitted and, indeed, supported with suitable resources to hire local eminent persons or experts as “specialised instructors” in various subjects

- A comprehensive teacher requirement planning exercise will be conducted across India and in each State

- The primary goal of overhauling the service environments and cultures of schools will be to maximise the abilities of teachers to do their jobs effectively

- Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools

- The creation of the school complex as the smallest viable unit of governance will help create vibrant communities of teachers

- teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes

- teachers will not be allowed any longer to conduct government work that is not directly related to teaching (except for rare events that do not interfere with their class work) so as to avoid excess load

- the role expectations of principals and teachers will explicitly include developing a caring and inclusive culture at their schools, for more effective learning for all, and for the benefit of all in their communities.

- teachers will be given more autonomy in choosing finer aspects of curriculum and pedagogy

- Teachers must be given constant opportunities for self-improvement and to learn the latest innovations and advances in their profession.

- Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers.

- Leaders such as school principals and school complex leaders will be have similar modular leadership / management workshops and online development opportunities

- Career management of teachers is an important area of reform to restore the prestige of the teaching profession

- A robust merit-based promotion and salary structure will be developed. A system of multiple parameters for proper assessment of performance will be developed for the same. Vertical mobility of teachers based on merit will also be paramount.

- Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy

**self note** to see the detailed changes tp teacher educational qualifications, see pages 120-121

- Substandard standalone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible

###Effective teacher recruitment and deployment

- Merit-based scholarships to encourage outstanding students to enter the teaching profession

- The recruitment process for teachers will be rigorous and transparent, designed to find the best teachers, instill confidence in them, and be a representation of the high regard and respect in which they and their profession are held by society.

- The practice of assigning teachers to individual schools based on overall student-teacher ratios will be replaced by a much more careful assignment system based on the educational needs of the children.

-  In hiring school teachers, at all stages but particularly at the Foundational, Elementary, and Middle stages, strong preference will be given to local teachers and to teachers fluent in the local language, so that teachers may communicate easily with students, and with their parents and community members

- Teachers will be recruited to the district, as is done now in many States, and then deployed to the school complex, and then, as per school needs, to individual schools.

- Suitable incentives will be developed for excellent teachers to desire teaching jobs in schools in rural, tribal, and remote areas, where they are especially needed.

- Stopping the practice of para-teachers

- Induction of freshly trained teachers into schools. They will register with an authority, and then be inducted and integrated into the school complex.

###School environment and culture that is conducive to quality education

- All schools will be provided with adequate physical infrastructure, facilities, and learning resources, either individually or within their school complex.

- Schools will attempt to develop and demonstrate a caring, collaborative, and inclusive school culture

- There must be no interruption to school schedules so that teachers can use their work time to concentrate solely on and excel at their chosen professions.

- Remedial programmes will be established at all levels to help teachers in ensuring that all students are achieving their potential.

- Rejuvenating academic support institutions (SCERT, BITE, DIET, BRC, CRC, CTE, IASE)

- Teachers will be able to connect to the local community, to encourage self-governance

- Developing high-quality material for teachers and teacher educators in Indian languages, including tribal languages, will be accorded priority in order to ensure quality learning in the local language and thereby the inclusion of all students

###Continuous professional development

- Flexible and modular approach to continuous professional development for teachers

- Revamping continuous professional development

- Self-directed personal development of teachers

- Online resources for continuous professional development

- In-school teacher development processes

- Recognising outstanding teachers

###Career management

- Tenure track system

- Parity in service conditions across all stages of school education

- Professional progression via promotions and salary increases

- Clearly laid out professional standards for teachers will inform career progression of teachers. A common guiding set of National Professional Standards for Teachers (NPST) will be developed by 2022, coordinated by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) and NCERT

- Periodic (annual or higher frequency) performance appraisal of teachers

- Professional progression via vertical mobility

###Approach to teacher education

- Moving teacher education into the university system; the four-year integrated B.Ed. programme

- The two-year B.Ed. programme for lateral entry into teaching

- Specialised instructors for specialised subjects

- Closing down substandard standalone teacher education institutions

- Pedagogical aspects of the four-year integrated B.Ed. programme

- There is an urgent need for additional special educators for certain areas of school education

##Equitable and Inclusive Education

- Objective: Achieve an inclusive and equitable education system so that all children have equal opportunity to learn and thrive, and so that participation and learning outcomes are equalised across all genders and social categories by 2030.

*self note** read pages 138-139 to get historical context on inequalities, along with detailed studies by various institutions

###Upliftment of underrepresented groups in education

- Emphasis on the Policy actions for students from underrepresented groups

- Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones.

- Inclusive education in teacher preparation

- Alternate pathways for recruitment of teachers from URG

- PTR in schools with a high proportion of learners from URGs should not be more than 25:1.

- Establishing mechanisms to address discrimination, harassment and intimidation

- Eliminating exclusionary practices

- Sensitising learners

- Inclusive curriculum

- Up to date information for each student will be maintained in the National Repository of Educational Data (NRED). While some education indicators will be common to all URGs, specific indicators may be tracked for particular groups

- A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from URG

- Alternative means of support besides scholarships

- District-wise financial assistance

- Adequate financial and other resources for institutions

- Funding will be made available for independent research on inclusive education

- Coordinated and integrated policy implementation to support under-represented groups The new policy is extremely ambitious, but I am not sure the government will be able to succeed with this.

The changes to infrastructure required are massive, and require complete cooperation from all state governments, and the funding and skilled manpower requirements are enormous. The former may be achievable, but the latter is nigh impossible within the next ten years.

There's so much to point out, I don't even know where to start. But I will say this - free bicycles mean nothing when the rest of the traffic and traffic discipline is so bad. If anything student mortality will increase. They talk about redoing roads, but attaining ownership is going to be a royal PITA since a lot of politics will be involved in the land acquisition process.

The only way this policy seams achievable to me is if somehow the entire country unites under a single polity and opposition (good or bad) is completely obliterated. The latter is definitely not a good sign for the health of this country. 3 Major issues with this,

1) How are we going to teach science to kids in their mother tongue? Most of our languages invent words on the go and is also unreliable in case of shifting their states.

2) Why are teachers allowed to pick what subjects to teach and how they'll teach them? I thought allowing students more flexibility will help them more to think practical and get better at decision making.

3) Is this even theoretically possible to implement within a single decade? The only practical way I see it if it's done in a more decentralised fashion given the enormous size of our country.

Overall this policy seems very good so far and thanks for the post OP. 👍 Thank you for your efforts op. I am hopeful it works out. BJP has gotten majority for work like this. Any info on eliminating coaching classes? ##Efficient Resourcing and Effective Governance through School Complexes

- Objective: Schools are grouped into school complexes to facilitate the sharing of resources and render school governance more local, effective, and efficient.

###Ending the isolation of small schools through school complexes

- Multiple public schools will be brought together in an organisational and administrative unit called the school complex.

- Each school complex will be a semi- autonomous unit that will offer education from the Foundational stage (age 3-8 years) till Grade 12 

- The principal of the secondary school will be the head of the school complex. S/he will be endowed with administrative, financial and academic powers to oversee the coordinated development of all the schools within the complex.

###Better resourcing of schools through school complexes

- While each individual school will be resourced adequately for their basic functioning, school complexes can house shared facilities and equipment at the secondary school that cannot be provided separately to each individual school.

- Teachers can also be shared among the schools in the complex. Areas/subjects, which by the nature of the curriculum, do not require a teacher for every school

- Adequate numbers of social workers will be appointed to the school complexes depending on the student population and the population of adult learners in that geography

- While the teachers will have the central role in student care and well-being, each school complex will have one or more capable counsellors available.

- An administrative plan to enable this must be created urgently by the government for each school complex, and should be integrated in the development plan for the complex.

###Fostering integrated education through school complexes

- The requisite focus and emphasis on ECCE will be enabled through the school complexes - by providing academic, resource and administrative support to all public institutions engaged in ECCE within the geographic area of that school complex. 

- School complexes will collaborate with institutions such as ITIs, Polytechnics, etc., with local businesses (industry, service, agrarian, etc.), health centres and hospitals, artists and artisans, and those with expertise in local crafts and traditions, to offer a range of vocational education courses

- Every school complex will create the infrastructure necessary to ensure that appropriate support is available to all CWSN, within the complex.

- Universities, colleges, and polytechnics in the vicinities of schools will contribute to improving school outcomes using the capacities relevant to school education that they may have. 

- The CPD of teachers will be an important responsibility of the school complex.

- The academic and teacher support system, and its institutions, will be aligned to the school complex system by the DSE and the SCERT. This will include the CRCs, BRCs, BITEs, and DIETs.

- Individual State governments will group schools into complexes according to the population distribution, connectivity, and other local considerations.

- The process of organisation of schools into complexes will also be used as an opportunity to assess the status of infrastructure at all schools and to allocate adequate one-time funding to upgrade them.

- Each school complex will have an SCMC comprising representatives from all the schools in the complex.

- Only a small fraction of schools in the country have support staff associated with them, with the result that teachers are generally in-charge of everything, from the midday meal to accessing supplies for the school.

###Effective governance through school complexes

- The DSE will devolve authority to the school complex and each complex will be a semi- autonomous unit. 

- The culture of working to a plan, both short-term and long-term ones, will be developed across the leadership of all educational institutions.

- Each district will have a District Education Council — Zilla Shiksha Parishad (DEC/ZSP) for oversight of the functioning of the school system in the district, and to enable the functioning and empowerment of the schools, school complexes, SCMCs, and SMCs.

- A culture of rigorous planning and review will be established at all levels by the corresponding apex governing bodies; the SDP, SCDP, and DEDP will form the basis for such reviews.

###Effective governance and management of individual schools within school complexes

- Schools are social institutions. They are an integral part of the community and its development. It is this community - including the parents of current and future students - that have the greatest and most immediate investment in the school.

- Functioning of all schools (government/public, private- aided and private-unaided) will be supervised by the SMC, the constitution of which is mandatory since the enactment of the RTE Act

- Specific efforts will be made on a continuous basis, to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the SMCs.

- The SMC will play a central role in performance management of teachers and head teachers, by endorsing their evaluation and assessment, including the annual appraisal, as detailed in the section on teachers

- SMCs will be empowered to have a voice to intervene on behalf of the school with the State and its bodies.

- The head-teacher/principal will be the executive head of the school - with responsibility and authority over all academic and administrative matters, while being accountable to the SMC, for the educational outcomes of the school and for the probity of its functioning, as per norms set by the DSE and detailed in the SDP.

- Teachers and principals will continue to be responsible for working together as a team, and with the parents and community members, to steer their own institutions towards excellence.

###Regulation and Accreditation of School Education

- Objective: India’s school education system is invigorated through effective regulation and accreditation mechanisms that ensure integrity and transparency and foster quality and innovation for continually improving educational outcomes.

###System architecture and roles in the school education system

- States will separate the regulatory function from that of other functions in education, such as policymaking, school operations and education provision, academic development and assessment, and ancillary services. They will thus establish clear, separate systems for policymaking, regulation, operations and academic matters.

- The Department of Education of the State will be the apex policy making body and shall also be responsible for policy and the overall coordination and monitoring of the system.

- An independent SSRA will be established to handle all aspects of school regulation including the oversight of the school system and implementation of Accreditation

- The DSE, which is also called Directorate of Public Instruction in some States, will continue to be responsible for running the public school system

- This whole effort of transforming the DSE from a regulator cum operator of schools to only an (effective) operator of schools may require a project-like ‘change management process,’ over a period of 2-3 years - DSEs should develop a framework and plan for this change and create a highly competent and empowered team to enact this change.

- The State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT) will be the apex body on all academic matters including curriculum, textbooks, standards for teacher related processes (e.g. recruitment, development, evaluation and assessment), and learning standards for all stages of school education including early childhood education.

- The CRCs, BRCs, and DIETs will provide educational support to teachers and schools in their geographies, for all stages of school education including early childhood education, and for vocational education.

- Every State must have one or more Boards of Assessment (BOA) which conduct the assessment for the school leaving certificate and certify the same.

- Schools and schools system will have full flexibility to choose their curriculum.

- All bodies and institutions mentioned in this chapter will develop rigorous plans each year to guide their work.

###Accreditation for autonomy with accountability

- The SCERT will develop a School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Framework (SQAAF) for each State. 

- School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Framework and Licence to Start a School as the basis for accreditation based regulation

- On the basis of SQAAF, all schools must self-accredit, by giving details on their meeting all the basic parameters, and the relevant supporting documents.

- The SSRA will set up a mechanism of audit of accreditation.

- Public scrutiny of all information and supporting documents regarding all steps and processes of the accreditation system will be used as a key mechanism for oversight and accountability. Thank god/Bhagwan I studied in English. Good luck to next generation who will now learn technical subjects  in languages that for all practical purposes are spoken only in India .there goes a significant advantage that our workforce had - fairly passable English . Now that's look like an educational policy for a developed country. Excellent post.  However from what I understood, board exams 10, 12 are getting scrapped. How are college admissions conducted then? Also, this might create problems for students applying to foreign universities. How does this CCE, as mentioned in the post, work? Thanks, OP, for the summary. Many of these ideas are good on paper, but I am a bit worried about the overall tendency.

1. This is another example of centralised, high-modernist reform. Policy is made by some Enlightened Ones sitting up in Raisina Hill, and the rest of the country has to implement it. This kind of attitude has always led to poor results in India. If we look at other old policies (industrial policy, labour policy, health policy, etc etc), they also have these high-sounding modern ideas. They look good on paper, and fail miserably on the ground. In the process, *they blight the lives of millions*. We should learn from this, not duplicate these errors. In particular, we should think, ""Why have these other policies failed? Why will this new policy be any different?""
2. The requirements of Tamil Nadu are very different from those of UP. It is outrageous to imagine that the same policy could apply to both of them. The respective states should be able to set their policies that suit their distinct circumstances.
3. Hindi should not be given any primacy over any other language. Because of historical and demographic reasons, Hindi is one of the central government's *official* languages, the other being English. Note that Hindi is *not* a ""*national* language"" by law, but only an official language. India does *not* have a national language, and it has done very well without it. Now, if Hindi is sought to be imposed on Indians, it can only lead to bad outcomes.
4. The policy pits English against the mother tongue. This is a false opposition. English has been used in this country for a hundred years now --- Mughal princes were learning English as a part of their education in Delhi 200 years ago. Most of the middle class in India (about 300 million people, depending on how you count) have some understanding of it. *English is now an Indian language, and we should proudly own up to it, just as we are proud of Hindi and Tamil and Bangla and other languages.* If the parents wish that their child should learn English as their mother tongue (there are many families who converse in English), it should be possible.
5. The mother tongue should definitely be taught, and better than it is being taught now. But there are definite advantages to learning technical subjects in English. The knowledge of English has opened many doors for many Indians. I would suppose most of the people reading this thread on this forum have been beneficiaries, professionally and socially, of their knowledge of English. I have no objection to the mother tongue being taught, but English should not be seen as a villain that needs to be suppressed.
6. Finally, I feel that primacy in determining the education of children should lie with parents and with states. Let a variety of schools following different syllabii be available, and let the parents choose where to send their kids. States (perhaps in coordination with each other) should set minimum educational outcome standards for all schools to meet. Brilliant summary.

Also - whoever built this policy has done a great job. This is the kind of change that India  needs. Now all that remains to be seen is how this will be implemented. The tldr makes it seem absolutely brilliant. If it is and is implemented properly the props to the government. This was an epic read. Thanks for taking the effort to not only read through but summarize and compare! I'm honestly most confused about the shift in the medium of instruction. We already have Hindi-medium / <regional language> medium schools, which teach the same curriculum in a different medium of instruction. Now, what is the new policy aiming to do differently? Not to mention, with so much internal migration in India, the mother tongue differs a lot from the regional / State language for many people, and hence I don't understand what the proposal to teach technical and non-technical subjects in ""mother tongue"" means. Taking english away as primary language is no way practical. Learning so many languages would not be interesting for children because it might really serve no purpose as its only emotional attachment towards languages that persuade us to learn it at this point. 

Like all languages in the world only the test of time will tell you which ones survive. What I suggest is to add loan words to English from your local language. Like chaddi, hopefully it will get accepted into the dictionary. 

Mind you this a logical approach and I speak my mother tongue just fine. I am surprised that no news source is covering the extensive and welcome overhaul brought by this policy. Everyone is hellbount on beating the dead horse of hindi imposition even after the said section was changed. Apart from a few typos (which is okay), the write-up is superb. Gonna read the new draft and see if something constructive can be summarised which can be sent to the MoE/MHRD. Quality post OP, will read in my free time. ##Curriculum and Pedagogy in Schools:

- Objective: Curriculum and pedagogy are transformed by 2022 in order to minimise rote learning and instead encourage holistic development and 21st century skills such as critical thinking, creativity, scientific temper, communication, collaboration, multilingualism, problem solving, ethics, social responsibility, and digital literacy.

- old policy made the infamous 10+2 school system. Helped with modernisation and standardisation of schools, but sub-optimal

- New system must take into account cognitive developments of students, and cater to changing thinking styles with age

- New proposal: 5+3+3+4

- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.

- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.

- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.

- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.

- Foundation stage is whatever latest ECCE research demands, as discussed above

- Preparatory stage slowly introduces more formal education through textbooks, etc. More generalist teachers, lays groundwork for all subjects

- Middle stage introduces more specialisation, with dedicated specialised teachers. Discussion of abstract concepts

- Secondary stage is four years of multi disciplinary study, with greater depth, greater critical thinking, greater attention to life aspirations, and greater flexibility and student choice.

- All stages will heavily incorporate Indian and local traditions, as well as ethical reasoning, socio-emotional learning, quantitative and logical reasoning, computational thinking and digital literacy, scientific temper, languages, and communication skills, in a manner that is developmentally appropriate and in the curricular/pedagogical style that is optimal for each stage.

- Key thrust in all reforms is ""learning to learn""

- Reorientation of system to emphasise : critical thinking, creativity, logical deduction, collaboration/teamwork, social responsibility, multilingualism, quantitative reasoning, and digital literacy.

- Aims to enable students to learn from all curricula

- Current curriculum is overcrowded, as proved by 1993 MHRD Yashpal committee and 2005 NCF. Will need to remove some items from curriculum in favour of a more engaging, holistic, experiential, and analysis-based form of learning.

- Teaching will be more interactive

- Reduction in load allows students to go into more depth in subjects of their choosing

- All fields are very important (arts, crafts, engineering, science, sports, etc.)

- No ""extra-curricular and co-curricular"" vs curricular activities, everything is equally important

- Student empowerment and choice is necessary for holistic development

- Increased flexibility in choice of subjects, especially in secondary stage

- No hard separation of arts and sciences; and “vocational” and “academic” streams

- Language is fundamental to education. Children between 2-8 have excellent ability to learn multiple languages (and must learn at least one language in this time period). Science proves that mother tongue is the best language for education. Multilingualism has proven cognitive benefits

- Bilingual approach for those whose language is different from the primary medium of instruction. Teaching learning materials will be bilingual as necessary

- Exposure to three or more languages in schools

- Standardising sign language. Indian Sign Language will be standardised across the country

**self note:** Quote from the draft: *Despite the rich, expressive and scientific nature of Indian languages, there has been an unfortunate trend in schools and society towards English as a medium of instruction and as a medium of conversation. Logically speaking, of course, English has no advantage over other languages in expressing thoughts; on the contrary, Indian languages have been specifically developed over centuries and generations to express thoughts in the Indian scenario, climate, and culture. Moreover, Indian languages are very scientifically structured, and do not have unphonetic, complicated spellings of words and numerous grammatical exceptions; they also have a vast and highly sophisticated ancient, medieval, and modern literature in the Indian context; as a consequence, they have a certain home-feel and “apnaapan” quality in the Indian context, making them easier, more relatable, and more relevant for children and adults alike to learn and speak, and with which to learn and express deep concepts across school subjects.* cite: page 81-82, I highly suggest reading these two pages

- Hindi speaking states have not done a good job integrating the three language policy of 1992, for the sake of national integrity. The three language policy improves the status of Indian languages. Central and State govt. will both invest in 3 language policy, especially schedule 8 languages

- Special teachers to be recruited for teaching language

- Students will learn science in both local language and English, so that by grade 10, they can easily manage science in either language. This bilingualism has proven to help many Nobel price laureates

- Flexibility in choice of language

- Choice of foreign language as an elective during secondary school (Japanese, German, French, etc.)

- During elementary stage languages will be taught in fun, interactive and natural way, to support function. Inspiration will be drawn from Samskrita Bharati and Alliance Francaise. Reading in local languages will be enhanced to include authors from medieval to modern age

- Many countries have demonstrated that being fluent in one's own culture, history and language is very good

- Languages of India will be a course on history of Indian Languages

- Classical language and literature will be emphasised

- Many important languages like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Pali, Prakrit must be preserved

- History changing Sanskrit will be incorporated into teachings as and when necessary. Sanskrit available in all levels of school.

- All courses available in medieval languages of India

- 2 year course on medieval languages

- All students will have some common fundamental ""core subjects and skills""

###Curricular integration of essential subjects and skills

- Evidence based reasoning ans inculcating scientific temper are primary goals

- Arts must be more integrated, as people who are more creative are much better in many streams

- Music and art experiences in the early years. Experience classical (Carnatic or Hindustani), notes, scales, rhythms, ragas, etc. local folk music to also be emphasised. Simple instruments in pre-schools to allow students to experince music on their own

- Arts to include theatre, poetry, painting, drawing, sculptures, carpentry, etc. Aim is to create over time a strong community of artists. Will also preserve indigenous cultures and traditions.

- Taking up at least one art for deeper study

- Technology use for bringing the arts to more students

- Technology use for bringing the arts to more students It's really sad that information on major reforms like this is obscured by media houses and people protesting against (in some ways, rightfully so) the three language policy, which is only a small part of the overall reform. Great work OP, more people should see this. I'll do my best to circulate this information by any means possible.

Also, I've been hearing that the government is accepting suggestions and will modify the draft to include them. Any idea if a last date has been set for finalizing and implementation? I'm saving this. Thanks OP! Firstly, thanks so much for summarising the key points. 

Did the policy talk about sex education? From the brief read I did of your summary, I couldn't see that it did. 

Also, I think the policy looks great, and I'm looking forward to reading the whole thing when I have more time. Really nice post OP. Appreciate the effort you put in. Thanks very much for the write-up. Extremely informative! Compliments on the effort taken to present this in an understandable format.

Well Done and Thanks ! The idea is good. I hope they don't fuck up the execution bbut what will happen to:

my kid has to be an engineer so he has to go through 2-3 years of rigourous millitriesque coaching center grind so that he can take those 5000 seats out of 10 lakh participants in a hope to get a job with decent salary which are vanishing faster than congress seats in elections? Can anyone throw more light on how ethics and morality would be taught using a proper framework ? I am really impressed both by the policy itself and the effort you put into the summary. I only hope this can be implemented by the people in charge keeping personal egos aside. I really wish I could be brought up under such a policy. Although the whole policy is a much needed modern reform to our education system, my favourite thing is the emphasis of techanical education in regional languages. Look at all the advanced engineering countries.. >Private schools are also prohibited from having the word ""public"" in their name.

So how will schools like Delhi Public School change their names? Will they just change it to Delhi School or something? OP, can you mention the page where I can find the ""English has hurt India"" text?

In my experience kids who do not learn English right from the beginning and try to pick it in later years (like say in third grade) never become fluent and confident enough. So I want to see what the committee argued. Thanks for the detailed post OP. Exceptional write-up, thank you for doing this. I am eagerly waiting for the next part. As someone who's going to college this year, will this new system affect me ? I plan on at atleast completing my masters. Good job with the post, I now see how you really mean it. Thanks for the excellent writeup. Ignoring the petty politics that will be obviously played by the parties, this policy is outstanding. A lot of these changes, especially getting rid of 10+2 is so good. Empahsis on fine arts, digital, ethics and philosophy is something we need so badly. Gonna be a herculean effort to implement though. Training new teachers, avoiding biases and politics, providing the infra, etc. is all gonna be big efforts. Hope they get done well. I have a doubt. Say, I am a malayali living in Tamil nadu. Will I be forced to learn technical stuff in Tamil? [deleted] I like that they're proposing to bring more freedom to choose your academic subjects. A lot of subjects I had during class 9-12 were irrelevant and redundant to what I wanted to truly learn and there were few ways to switch to a combination which I preferred.

CBSE also doesn't really make students aware of the large number of subjects available such as specialised vocational courses. My school teachers didn't know these subjects existed and did nothing to see that they're intergated into the present curriculum. Thanks for the write-up man. Really appreciate it.

Can I ask where in the draft is the proposition to make all private schools non-profit? I only found one mention and that doesn't seem to state it as a mandate. This new policy looks really good , I hope it is implemented properly.
I specially like the idea of complexes, it will help teachers with niche skills to be better utilized and better pay

@op good work👍 I kinda wish I'd been brought up in this system. Great write-up op . This will be great if implemented well.

Schools will not be for profit? I think this will cause some problems. There are many politicians with schools for generating profits. Extraordinarily forward thinking policies, but would've never seen this without your summary post OP. Thank you! My daughter goes to a Montessori School. I am looked at like a madman who is playing with the future if his child. The competition crazed Indians really cannot look at the big picture. Good to note that many of the concepts of Montessori ( and other similar ideologies) are incorporated into the draft policy.

What people need to realise is that education has to be fun for kids if it has to play a role in shaping their future. You cannot just put them in the meat grinder take away their childhood and expect them to excel. They may, but they come out the system as one dimensional adults.

Really hope the changes come to take place. Fuck you,Modi. English was literally the only thing India got going for it. Lol. Every single scientific journal is written in English. 

The only thing US companies find better in Indian companies when compared to China is the English language. Thanks OP for the hard work. I would have given you gold but don't have enough of it! thanks man for writing! I'm reading at 1:48 am and my eyes are glowing with hope and excitement with bit of regret ke thoda pahle peda hi Gaye! Still no sex education, the rest of it is great though especially:

> Arts, Sports, Music, literature, etc. are all now of primary importance, and each student **has to specialise in one of these**, in addition to courses of their choice Already commented, but I think this should be stickied for a week or two so people are aware of the country's education reforms. NEP should have implemented this long ago when CCE failed. Enjoy your gold. As an NRI student studying in an international Indian school ,I'm pretty curious how would they implement those here.
like we got almost all languages in India..
Hindi Urdu Malayalam Tamil Telugu are the most common..
IMO by the Grace God we got advanced features like Smart boards,labs etc which majority of pvt.cbseSchools here lack.
As our school is one of the largest in middle-east we are facing some rent difficulties as they have increased the rate..about 9million riyals I guess..
I'm sayin this becouse it was meant to be purchased from the kingdom by pm indira Gandhi (btw our girls section is situated on the land gifted by the kingdom authorities) .cuz of this we had to go through a tough time..
Btw I study at iisjed ksa.. What about people who have studied since primary in english medium and as a result only have basic understanding of this so called mother tongue(mine is hindi). 
Am i supposed to magically learn it for and do a whole translation for everything i have learnt up till now? Hey. Thanks for the summary.

Had a small doubt, does the RTE get benefited under the education policy? One thing to keep note of is resistance to change, it will be hard for those old teachers and unmitovated one's. >The RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. 

Hell yeah! Holy fuck. This new system doesn't feel Indian at all Great post,man. The NEP looks great too,hope govt passes it this year only. Big Bang PR reforms. 

There are 2 parts of this plan which are excellent and will have more impact than most others -

1) Including breakfast in the meal plan

2) More focus on studying in the mother tongue.


The key issue with education, is that there are FAR too many factors which impact outcomes. 

The short version is that if society improves, education improves.

That's why feeding kids is the biggest deal, and one of the key reasons any improvement in attendance has been seen. 

Mid-Day meal schemes are the model the world learned from third world countries and implemented in their schools.


However, the biggest issue will always be 

1) Jobs : As long as there is a strong economic incentive for a student or family to choose an economically sensible path over a good student-subject match (arts students) - people will take subjects they are bad at. 

They will get bad grades, and since they need the grades to pass - they will cheat.


2) Student teacher ratio issues: With 50 students to 1 teacher, we are FAR away from getting people to do well in school. One on One coaching has had one of the biggest impact on student performance in experiments (other than exercise and nutrition).

3) The difficulty of ascertaining intent and testing: With 50:1 students to teachers, each teacher has to go through millions of exams papers.

Exam papers are at leas solvable with those constraints. Match contents with subject material. Adjust for language and content.


Move to a more vague system that requires teacher judgement, and time taken to check results goes up FAST.

This increases costs, often increases reagent requirements, and results in teacher inability to examine. Pg: 83

This is a disaster in making. Force feeding three languages to pre-primary to Grade 2 students is nothing but torture. This will fall hard. 

There is absolutely no need of third language in school. STEM should be taught in English only and rest in state's local language. If you don't then middle-class parents will always hunt for schools that offers full english medium instruction as they are doing now in all tier 1 & 2 cities.

pg 84:
> It is well-understood that young children learn and grasp nontrivial concepts most quickly in their home language/mother tongue.

Also this very notion of mother-tongue based education will help is plain wrong. We live in a very pluralistic society and workplace today. If a Gujarati/Bengali family works in B'lore or H'bad will their kids get Gujarati/Bengali lecture in school in those cities? You get instructions in English and are forced to take local language or Hindi as 2nd language.

Bottomline...Will Mr. Modi spend 10% of GDP on education? I have doubt.

I have with few Chinese and Vietnamese in my team. They & their kids are fluent in English. [China investing heavily in English](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anismuslimin/2017/11/30/why-asian-countries-are-investing-so-heavily-in-the-english-language/#5b51c2895e85) and here we are planning to push Sanskrit & Hindi and sideline English. Astrology and vastu shastra are not mandatory? Surprising.. I am contemplating so many ways they will fuck it up.

Lucky I passed out early. 

Ez. Focus on mother tongue is a step backwards IMO.

Most students right now suffer from a *lack* of English language.


Science and Maths are also are primarily ENGLISH subjects. Not because muh antinationalism but because Europe developed those languages and not us.

Studying in local languages will fuck you up when you aim for more sepecific and higher level branches within each of those subjects. This is brilliant!
I kind of agree with Hindi and English being taught all over, it certainly helps if people move to different states. Also, mother tounge us usually taught at home, so it's not as if one is losing the grasp of his/her mother tounge unless things are different at home. with 11 + 4 -  one cannot go for MS as..GRE needs 16 years of education FFS",2019-06-04 03:46:45

So SBI is deducing Rs 330 for PMJJBY from my account without my consent. I have never opted for this scheme. When I contacted the branch, they said that this is mandatory deduction, on the order of the government, and they will continue doing so every year as long as I have account there.

I tried escalating issue, but no one is even trying to help. What can I do?"," Go to RBI Banking Ombudsman or change your bank account What you can do is - 

1. Ask them to produce the consent form which mentioned that you have enrolled in insurance scheme. 
2. You can mention the insurance in form 80c for tax savings.
3. Get the same consent in writing from branch manager, to the last details. 

If you get the same in writing then - Congratulations . .

You've become one of the million people who'll be featured on info-graphic when our govt. will share it's achievements. Think of it as citizen stupidity cess if it helps you.

Sala crop insurance bhi was the exact same racket with compulsory deduction of premiums without any enrollment and a polite fuck you if you went to ask for money in case of crop failure. Contact 1800229090 (9AM to 9PM) and tell them you want to discontinue the policy from this SBI account and continue it next year from another account. Or you can also write to pmjjby.ops@sbilife.co.in.

In the policy document it's clearly mentioned that you can discontinue anytime prior to 30 days of renewal. Your relationship manager is lying through his/her teeth. The deactivation of the policy can also likely be done online via email itself. As a standard procedure, they'll simply say there was been a system issue and they'll  refund the money. But this will happen only when you go and enquire about it. First they will try to convince you indirectly, next they'll refund.

Who do you think in India deserves more credit and is fighting for people?," I don’t think India should look at US as inspiration at first place . It’s a shit show there also . No one. If there is such person, then s/he is either made irrelevant (Anna Hazare, Medha Patkar) or ends up dead for going against the corrupt system. AoC isn't a gem but Andrew Yang certainly is Yogendra Yadav and Atishi Marlena come to mind. I might not agree with all of their policies especially YY but these two come across as earnest politicians who want to do good to the society. There could be more that I might not know. Modi I understand the intent of your question but AoC is *certainly* not a gem. Yang is, though! I like Pete Buttigieg over Sanders and AOC among the Dems. AOC comes across as well-intentioned and earnest but occasionally naive. Sanders' policy platform is an unsustainable mess. Good intentions aren't worth much on their own if you're not the sharpest cookie in the box.  


In general I'm skeptical of economically left-wing people, they're either naive - don't understand why their nice-sounding ideas don't actually work...  
...or manipulative psychopaths - they pretend to care about the people and promise them free shit to get elected.   


In India   
Congress: Sachin Pilot and Shashi Tharoor. Both come across as rather principled and sincere to me.   
BJP: Piyush Goyal. Atishi Marlena

Sachin Pilot

Economists generally aren't fond of free college https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/02/26/468298576/economists-on-candidates-proposals-mostly-bad

You can even go to r/Askeconomics (they provide sources and if comments don't have sources , they get removed) to ask about what economists think of free college

It's not that free college is a bad idea . Economists favor making college free only for the poor and not the rich . 

However there are alternative policies that are just as good for example Australia . 

Most of their universities are public which is why they are so cheap and prices don't inflate much  . Plus they have HECS loan system , Where you can get a zero interest loan and you only have to start paying it if you're earning above a certain threshold and if you don't then you don't need to make any payment and you have the peace of mind that your loan obligations will expire eventually . Though many loans might not be paid back and might be forgiven by the taxpayer . That's fine because it's cheaper than universal programs

Even if your income reaches that threshold where you have to make payments of that loan . It'll only be 4 or 8 % of your income . This should be seen as graduate tax imo 

So not free college but really close to it . Economists favor those policies over free college . It doesn't make sense to make college free given that the personal  return on investment is high on a college degree . However public subsidies can still exist like the Aformentioned system

Forgiving everyone's student loans isn't exactly rooted in good economics 

However that's not to say the good welfare policies can't exist.  The aformentioned one is  close to free college. Economists tend to prefer economically progressive policies over universal this and Universal that and also don't like  stupid proposals like   privatising everything 

Universal healthcare is widely supported though Ooh! AoC & Bernie.,, you need to delve a little deeper into US politics. Start with Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Paul Ryan... Kanhaiya maybe..?

It was below their dignity to take something that is so cheap. However, Vodafone would not capitalize on this amazing brand value. Instead, they leeched on to these users without upgrading their network. Eventually, everyone bought a second sim from Jio and slowly it became their primary sim. Later, a few fully jumped to Jio.

Jio was literally too good and Vodafone was too slow. Look at how Airtel fights Jio and keeps upgrading. Vodafone tried to squeeze far too much and instead had nothing to hold on to! Great gift from Pranab Mukherjee. While he gets a Bharat Ratna, his actions will probably result in the exit of one of the highest investors in India. Reliance entering a mature market and going all guns blazing pocketing govt and policy makers to get a foothold in the telecom market is an indication of future potential.   All the praises being sung about by the analysts is sounding alarm bells.   These narratives are being spun to sell these businesses off to public successfully.   With slowdown hitting the economy locally and globally, Reliance is going to suffer disproportionately due to its legs in highly sensitive retail sector.   Other way to look at it is also wasting of capital or capacity in the industry(telecom).   No. Of companies gone bankrupt and capital extinguished due recklessness of Reliance is costing the country in terms of jobs and tax revenues. The govt. favoured Reliance by policies and rule changes without which Reliance would not made any headway either in telecom or oil & gas.   Consumers have benefited is a silver lining, but costs is paid by other sections of economy in terms of job losses, NPAS and consequently lack of capital to necessary sectors that require investment.   Reliance could have been more socially responsible by subsidised fuel from its refinery that would have had multiplier effect on the economy by reducing the costs of transportation.   Reducing telecom rates have helped bollywood and made people distracted from self development and watch medias/videos during their work hours.

Suggest take 1 policy for your parents. Split it into a base policy of ₹5 lacs. Then take a top up policy of ₹10lacs. Ensure that top up policy can cover your parents.

The 2nd policy you can take for yourself, wife and kids. Here also take a base policy of ₹5-10 Lacs and top up policy.

Policy,India investing more money in Solar Power than Coal for first time,br5aut,https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/india-coal-solar-power-investment-money-climate-change-iea-a8921961.html,," Installing solar panels on any newly constructed house should be mandatory..and give like 10 years for every existing house to have solar panels installed Good to hear some uplifting news.

Although India should also increase its nuclear energy. Solar is not always reliable and it needs a lot of space for the farms. Which means a lot of forests need to be cleared. Interestingly 6 of the worlds 10 biggest solar plants are in our country - 

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_photovoltaic\_power\_stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_photovoltaic_power_stations) I was in Bangalore airport last week and there was a screen telling that a large part of the power for the terminal comes from solar. Dont remember the data but it saves a couple of thousand tons of co2 from being released in the air. This should be done for all our airports and train stations. They could use house roof as solar plants. Make it on grid. And plant more forests. Would be a better idea than using barren lands. form being carbon neutral, alog with renewable energy we need mass tree plantation all across the nation. Major cities this year noticed highest temperature in last decade. But can we ensure that this does not happen again

https://youtu.be/fVvUy5RRKf8 Hearing good news from foreign media because Indian media just shows bullshit. They should add solar panels on all metros and metro station. 

&#x200B;

I really like the work Cochin is doing in regards to their metro and transport systems. I see people here are uninformed abt the solar waste with the increase in its capacity. The Hindu and The wire have fantastic articles with evidence to proof the point. Please do Google ""the Hindu article on solar waste"" before you downvote. Your gut felling can't be an evidence. Modi Ji visionary It is time to move on to solar and nuclear power as there will be scarcity for coal in coming years This is some much needed good news Good to here this kerala land prices about to spike This is fab! Is there a reliable data source for past yearly investments into various types of power generation? The power of the non-renewables   industrial lobby runs governments around the world (like the cigarette companies).

Solar and other sustainable energy sources will never be tax free and affordable to the average Indian, till oil and coal run out in a few hundred years or sooner. 

Its all shady politics and business.  Good News!!!! Expo 2020 is committed to hosting one of the most innovative World Expos in history, and ‘2020 Hours of Code’ brings to life its theme of ‘Connecting Minds, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFs4vir_WsTxiWN00_TUeFqaWzuw4a4Pc 

Guys see it. It will clear your doubts about the harm and the benefits of nuclear energy. Just give it a watch. Thanks. nice Finally something better to mankind is happening All the people talking about installing Solar Power on their roofs should know the basic thermodynamic laws. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed it can only be transferred from one state to another. The way the grid system works is based on the demand there is supply of energy. If domestic houses start depending upon solar panels with no good technology of storage in place the chances are your electrical equipment's would stop functioning as the solar panels cannot increase its output capacity based on the increase in load. We can never generate 100% renewable energy in the form of solar or wind power. As a resident of a coal state I say this is a good step towards cleaner future. The amount of pollution people have to bear for energy production is beyond imagination. Whole city and neighbouring cities are covered in coal. It's everywhere - your clothes, bed, water, food, air inside your body. Plus the amount of pollution a coal power plant makes is just outrageous. Coal quality isn't too good here and it makes less power but more smoke. Respiratory diseases are common here. And the whole cities atmosphere is freaking hot like it will boil your eggs. India doesn't have a law when it comes to disposing solar waste. A huge pile of solar waste is already collected which will keep on increasing exponentially. It's gd that we have switched to solar but we have completely forgotten about the waste management in this section. Solar power is not ultimate solution. If you just decrease transmission losses then there is no need of solar power right  now The solar panels are made in China unfortunately. Same with wind turbines.

Even science. I'll tell you why. Because out languages refused to evolve when there was a possibility of that happening. Language needs to keep up with new inventions to be relevant. A language needs to accept words, ideas etc from others to stay current. We're a couple of centuries behind, and making worthiest shit up rather than accepting common words.

Source: did my schooling in marathi. Science was a nightmare full of a alien made up words that no one understood: karba dvi pranil is carbon dioxide, amla is acid, and so on (I've either repressed or forgotten other made up shit, but it was way worse). Impossible to access scientifuc literature and understand what they are talking about even if i learned english in school, because I didn't know what english words the made up bullshit corresponded to.

If I have to learn made up words in a dead language (sanskrit) that no one else in the outside world understands, and I find hard to understand, since I'm not a native speaker of the dead language, why should I bother learning those words rather than words that everyone else understands? 

We should teach everyone our native languages in school, we should give people an option of finishing schooling in native languages (at the cost of struggling during higher education or jobs), but we shouldn't kid ourselves by claiming that reinventing the wheel is a good use of our time and resources. 

Learning english, and keeping stem education in english has a massive advantage of facilitating mobility within the country as well as outside.


Having said that, fuck ""english medium"" schools where teachers either can't speak english or choose not to, ""because students don't understand"". Fuckers, do your job, and teach them english. What's with the attitude against people learning English?? Explain this to me, downvote whatever. I want reasoning for why the article in the print has that bit about English, it reeks of jealousy in my opinion. Mostly makes sense except for the hate for English and right wing trigger words / bogeyman of elites . Could someone ELI5 the difference between the two? So, Indian parents have four years to stress their children out as opposed to current only two years. With such a massive overhaul, i wish they had proposed some sort of sex education in the draft.

The influence of RSS on the MHRD might be troublesome in the future. This policy looks pretty great on paper. If they actually manage to translate this into reality, our education system might finally be able to not drive students into despair. A very simple question to all commentators here because reddit is clearly not a representative of India and I'm curious what type of people are commenting here when in India only 15% speak English. 

(1) What type of school did you go to? Govt/Convent/Private?

(2) What was your socio-economic class? 

(3) What was the medium of instruction? The last 4 years will be like semi -colleges . More freedom from schoollife but less freedom than college one. Similar to what we see in anime. > In addition to Sanskrit, the teaching of other classical languages and literature of India, including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Pali, Persian, and Prakrit has also been recommended for ensuring that these languages and literature stay alive and vibrant, especially in states where they may be best taught and nurtured.

Why is Urdu missing? It's as much a classical and important language like Sanskrit. Thats the old Formula that was being 4 decades ago. I remember my mother telling me about metric exam being the 11 standard exam followed by inter exam after 3 years. Imagine the ruckus during document verifications. It looks like those, who would want to go abroad for higher studies, will continue to lose a year (to complete 16 years of education, but 5+3+3+4 = 15 will mean doing another/a masters degree of 2 years, thus wasting 1). A lot of pseudoscientific bullshit will become part of the curriculum. This policy makes English an unnecessary villain.And also makes quite large faulty assumptions.

> We further observe that English has not become the international language that it was expected to become back in the 1960s. 

Really ? Which world are they living in ? English is the primary language for all the major international organisations and businesses.

>  most advanced countries use their own native languages as the languages of interaction and transaction, and it is suggested that India works towards the same, or its rich language and cultural heritage, 

They fail to notice that All these countries are quite monolithic in languages while India is not. What language is going to be the lingua franca ? >According to the draft, the “foundational stage will comprise five years of flexible, multilevel, play-based, activity-based, and discovery-based learning, continuously incorporating the latest research in ECCE (Early Childhood Care and Education) **as well as the various time-tested Indian traditions for cognitive and emotional stimulation of children**.”

What do these time tested traditions mean? I have never heard of them.

-- copied from somewhere else :P India has a policy in which India cant use nuclear weapon against country which does not have nuclear weapon. If pakistan gives up nuclear weapon, India cant use nuclear weapon against pakistan. Looks like win-win to me. Wow...don't think his military overlords back home will be amused by this statement. Lol what's with this posturing? Pakistan's policy of nuclear weapons is far more hawkish than India's. We have a clear no first use doctrine. But Pakistan has consistently been muddying the waters on their policy, making it seem that even a minor conventional skirmish can ignite into a nuclear conflict. That's why they have tactical nukes. This makes sense from their perspective, since they want to prevent any attack, and since their armed forces are weaker than India's. (That's also why they support terrorists, since it's not feasible for them to fight an army so large.) 

If India does destroy its nukes, what are the chances that Pakistan will follow suit? What are their incentives to do so? None. IK is a good guy.  But this was just political posturing.  Empty talk.

As an idea, it would be good if the region denuclearizes.  That would include China, though, and that ain't going to happen.

If there is just a two-hour power cut in these cities, the generator sets alone generate 1 tonne of particulate matter.”

Environment compensation charge being levied on trucks entering Delhi also acted as a deterrent, he said. “A report shows that because of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, truck traffic has reduced by 30% and pollution has gone down by 7%.”
> 
> Among other factors that contributed to the reduction in pollution was the decrease in dust emanating from construction sites; large-scale plantation of trees; shutting down of two thermal power stations; and increase in forest cover, the CM said. The coming winter will tell the real story. Kejri is a good man. This makes me really happy. Keep up the good work delhi folks. Isn't the pollution down by 25% because of the monsoon? Some constructive politics over here So everyone except Modiji has achievements of their own. Cool. I wish kejriwal has shown the same tact when he got into power . Playing politics with center is detrimental to the people of the state . He could have achieved lot more if he did not join hands with all the corrupt parties like Congress , Rjd ,etc Toh iss saal patake bajein ya nahi? IMO rains are a bigger reason than any policy from center or the state. Doesn't this look like the monolith from Kubrick's Space Odyssey? Given that 2nd monolith was found on the dark side of the moon where Chandrayan landed. Guess we need to handle Delhi's first before we advance to next level. Thank you honorable Prime Minister Modi Ji.",2019-09-08 01:04:13
Politics,RIP Sushmaji!,cn2k4z,https://i.redd.it/c7xfb27o8ze31.jpg,," A powerful orator,people's minister. Gone too soon I will ALWAYS remember her as a kind lady with a helping hand, just a Tweet away!


Stuck in Arab country? just a Tweet

Lost Passport in abroad? just a Tweet

Need Visa for treatment? just a Tweet Her last tweet very fitting. Om Shanti she did good. great service for the nation. if there is an afterlife journey, I hope she gets first-class tickets. rest in peace In an ideal world, she would have been BJP's PM candidate The BJP regime had the finest leaders and she's the second one who's gone. It just breaks my heart. it's really unbelievable that there are political leaders in a corrupt country who wants to work for their nation and she was one of them. I hope her energy transcends into the party to inspire  other leaders to work with  the same principles. sorry to be a noob, but can someone please explain? I understand that to be the flag of Japan, and ik that she was minister of external affairs, but did she have a special link with the country? A beautiful cartoon, but spoilt by the huge and in-your-face watermark. I understand the need for an artist's need for recognition, but not at the expense of spoiling the art itself। Delhi lost its only two women former-CMs in a short period. There is a very strong and unnecessary undercurrent of some people. These are the people who say they will not be mourning her death because she was an accessory of the Hindutva agenda. 

Like, why beat your chest about such matters? The woman did more than your social media addicted ass will ever do. Some people are just a vehicle of ideas than.. Actual people. The Ironlady of India. Would have been nice if it was like the setting sun. May her soul rest in piece... I understand the sentiment, but it's a terrible cartoon. Her bindi represented as the setting sun (as someone explained below)? I didn't realise it was 'setting' from the image -- unless I am missing something here. Or is she up in the clouds? Like ascending to heaven? Either ways, there is no significantly poignant message, and that watermark really ruins it. I thought the words were part of the cartoon, and was trying to decipher it. RIP Why do we always get consumed by irrationality when it comes to the demise of public figures. Below a clip of a great, powerful minister denying a student his identity

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBQn1mKcfB4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBQn1mKcfB4) Can i get some F's in the chat bois I've seen her on TV for most of my rather long life, and she never looked a day above 50, right until yesterday. Unfortunately, she also didn't look a day below 50 even when I saw her the first time on TV in 90s. I don't mean to call her ugly: she's a beautiful and elegant lady. I'm just talking about the skincare regime. Such consistency in one's looks through many years is only something bollywood people tend to successfully pull off and she did it. She truly is an inspiration to us all in that department. 

Most people who read the news have mixed thoughts on Sushma ji and despite all the distasteful stuff in her record (e.g. getting papers done for Chhota Modi), there was some good work done by her too. I have great respect for her for being a woman and doing so well in politics, setting an example for all women in the country. She could've made a ton more money and name for herself being a Jethmalani-level lawyer but she stuck with politics till the end, so, somewhere deep down, there was a genuine desire to help the public. 

I have a theory regarding her death. She worked so hard for this party full of idiots, dedicated her life to it, and got it to the greatest heights it has ever seen. Then, Modiji decides to give her job to a man 3 levels her junior and doesn't offer her anything in the cabinet. Not even the Ministry of silly walks. This was part of the removal of the old guard. Jaitley didn't get anything, Rajnath Singh got demoted. Subramanian Swamy didn't even get a gift basket.  So, that was hurtful but she treaded on.

Then, the biggest day in BJP's history happens. It's the one thing they've ever done that gets near-unanimous approval from the public. And Sushma ji hears of it first on Rajya Sabha TV. Then she tweets her bittersweet mood: happy that this happened to the BJP in her lifetime, and deeply sad that she wasn't involved. Not even given a slice of this cake she's been baking all these years. 

BJP says they did the #370Delete because the political climate was apt. Who made the political climate such? People like Sushma. A lot of those people are sitting out, and that can be painful. Some of them took it better than others. 

I refuse to believe that her last tweet wasn't sent with mixed emotions and was purely an expression of happiness. Why did she mention life (or death) at all instead of sending a simple congratulations. That, my friends is how Modi, in a way, killed Sushma, and that's why he showed tears at the funeral. But he had to do what he had to do.

I don't mean to smear any party or individuals, this is just a theory. Hate the game, not the player. Sushma ji's death might just have been a lesson for us in how cruel and emotionally draining politics can get. Many of us complain about office politics and that small group of bitchy coworkers but we never realize that there are people undergoing situations fifty times worse than us and have to deal with office politics from the best fucking politicians in the country. Is it on record? [deleted]",2019-08-07 20:43:14
Politics,Congress committing suicide: Congress whip in Rajya Sabha resigns to protest party's stand on Article 370.,cm9t18,https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/india/story/article-370-congress-whip-in-rajya-sabha-bhubaneswar-kalita-resigns-1577458-2019-08-05,," Weren't they supporting UAPA amendment a few days back? What is wrong with them? It's good for Congress and the country. About time the party is dissolved. The party died long back and it should be given burial.

What BJP does hardly infuriates me. I hate their ideology and what it stands for. But the pusillanimity of the parties outside NDA is unacceptable. No coherence, no unity. They are just letting BJP run away with everything. The country deserves better not these spineless idiots. His argument makes sense, as long as one carefully distinguishes 'the right thing to do' from ' the politically expedient thing to do'.  

It *is* political suicide for the INC to stand against something that a majority of the country would oppose. That would just allow the BJP to cast the INC as ""muslim loving"" , ""traitors to India"" etc, and that would find traction among large swathes of the population.

What the majority believe, especially in  an education/thinking challenged polity like ours, is not necessarily correct. But this is too subtle a challenge for the INC to overcome as it stands today, battered and ramshackle and bereft of effective leadership. Excellent. I await the day that the BJP and their supporters point to an empty congress bench and yell ""THEY DID IT"" or ""THEY DID IT FIRST"".

In case people forget - the congress won its previous elections as members of a coalition, but they still got something like 20% of the total votes. Naice exit strategy. Congress Stand in Rajya Sabha is primarily because of Ghulam Nabi Azad being the leader of opposition. He is from Kashmir. Going by the glee shown by Congress leaders or workers elsewhere, it’s clear that they are in favour of the bill as they still harbour hopes of getting the Hindu vote. I bet that the MP would join BJP very soon. https://twitter.com/brijeshkalappa/status/1158390992606654464

this basically explains congress of today. Everyone supporting this bill are cheering cause they are not sitting in kashmir right now? There's a reason there are So many troops in kashmir and why curfew has been imposed and wifi has been put off: but these aren't permanent. This is going to aggrevate the opposition in kashmir and a civil war may occur ( I pray it won't). It is easy to cheer when you are not at risk. This is setting a very dangerous precedent and whilst I agree smth had to be done, people's lives have to be taken into account, and frankly I don't think they have been. At least some people in the congress still have some brains. https://twitter.com/milinddeora/status/1158405693067558912?s=19
Hopefully the leaders of the congress in the lok sabha do a better job tomorrow. So sprcial status of Assam must revoked and see Kaliya reaction TIL - Whip is not just a slang, but an official way of describing that position. Huh..!! 371 should also be revoked. Next in the List These idiots said the same thing during demonetisation as well.

Those who opposed it were branded as supporters of black money. We all know how that ended. Yes, they are. Its better to fight the good fight. Congress is doing that and it can be proud of that I'm not Indian but how do you guys deal with all the party Poltics and just all of it for me it's like a few parties yah standard red party and blue party you guys have so much. To look at and so much changing. I wish Congress in my country would commit suicide. . . That Assamese MP is a hypocrite. Assam is way less integrated with India than Kashmir.",2019-08-06 01:01:19
Politics,I wish I was well informed in subjects or had opinions like you guys.,crzhie,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/crzhie/i_wish_i_was_well_informed_in_subjects_or_had/,"Every post I see, there's someone who's passionate about the topics ranging from politics to sports to finance and I have opinions on none of them that can be backed with facts. It's like some of you are like walking encyclopedias. 

Just a random appreciation post."," Lol, there's no such thing like too well informed. The people whom you're talking about are either experts in the subject or are avid readers. All you have to do to make your wish come true is to know about your own line of work, and read about the topics you're interested in. For example, I'm a medical professional and I have responded to a couple of related posts, and since I like the posts related to politics too, I read up on the topic before responding. It's about how badly you want to know the topic, not about how much you already know Firstly don't club everyone into one ultra smart person. A highly upvoted post/comment will be likely from an expert and naturally it will be rare. Secondly, if you are in awe of this level of expertise in general, then it is likely you haven't got expertise of this level in any area. But you will, as you grow up. And also as you act on this awe from now itself, if you do that. Thirdly, when you start doing research or reading you will realise how much you are capable of and it's almost guaranteed you underestimate that as of now. Vastly. I literally spout bs until someone calls me out on it and then I have to read about it to not make a fool of myself any further Read more on topics you like to master. It takes years of passionately reading different voices on topic to form an informed opinion. Even a less read person can sound well informed to someone who doesn't read at all.

The point is : read. Read about stuff you like. Make time for it. Instead of knowing every little news on Internet, focus on what you want to read. 

We have an information mountain at our hands, but we have to pick what kind of info we want. Don't get overwhelmed by the size of the mountain, pick the stones that you need. 

That's all you need. _I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing._

~Plato Read both sides of the story from many sources and then form your own opinions. Everyone has an agenda. Relatable If you start reading a good Newspaper regularly then it will help you build opinions. You think people here or anywhere online actually know what they're talking about? Oh, you innocent babe! You are good man. These days it is so easy to have an opinion. You are way above the rest of the crowd. Stay there. No sweetie, people are really lonely here Nobody here knows anything. Everyone is just faffing, or at least 90% of them. None of us are walking encyclopaedias. Each on of us just knows more than usual about 1-2 subjects. But everyone specialises in different subjects, so it feels like everyone knows everything. Lol half of the upvotes on political posts are from bots and astroturfing is the way of life for pro govt voices here. TBH, many posters do appear *opinionated* but often speak without coming across as *well-informed* - and resort to *ad hominem* attacks and downvoting if asked for validation of their claims.  So don't be shy and join the crowd... Beg to differ on the politics bit. Indians and political information is not always well informed and involves a lot of cherry picked information. Both left and right thinkers are guilty of this. You just gotta read more. Bonus if you have personal experience or have been involved with the subject of the discussion. Who says people here are well informed lmao 😂. Bruh we are all just shitposting.

Second. Its not rocket science like they want to think it is. If you really want facts, then you'll have to do your own first hand research. But do remember that facts are only bits and pieces that form a **narrative** and a narrative typically stands on both fact based and rumor/propaganda based opinions.

The opinions you typically hear from different people reflect their support for a narrative, its immaterial for them whether its based on facts or not. In general, a narrative is supported by both facts and a bit of propaganda by media. We live in an age of information warfare, so propaganda is bound to exist on both sides. If one side ceases to create propaganda, the other side spreading it wins in the narrative battle. And losing this battle could mean losing both elections and public support.

Regarding which narrative to support for, read all the facts and opinions in support and against that narrative, and then ask your heart. Your own prejudices will also contribute in forming that narrative. Some people have a pro-establishment bias while others have an anti-establishment one, so they'll accept or reject narratives based on that bias. You can also be a centrist and support bits and pieces of both narratives, and your support for a narrative can even change as new information comes up. Hey that’s OK. You might be informed or be opinionated or passionate about other things. No one gets to decide if someone who has opinions on politics is smarter than someone who has opinion on smartphones or video games. 

Go easy on life. It’s not a race to be smart. Look at the strength of the sub. 242k members. Obviously there will experts from different fields. Not too late mate, you can learn too. Read about logical reasoning and critical thinking, then apply it to world affairs.

Also nobody is fully informed about anything. We learn something new every day. Well let me leave you with a tidbit. There is a term in psychology called the Dunning Kruger effect. It states that people mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. 

So while people may have an opinion on everything , unless they are an expert or at the very least have all the facts on a topic to make a proper assessment most people are usually speculating. Depends on what u are interested in As someone here already commented, it's about how badly you want to learn the subject. I am crazy about software engineering - building beautiful, maintainable, secure software. Almost everyday, I read on topics design patterns, distributed systems, etc. There's a LOT to learn as I am just starting out, but it feels good when you understand what the ""pros"" in the team are talking about. 

In the end, it's all about hard work. India has 1.3 billion people. So definitely somebody knows something. You also something about something. ! Don't fall for the peer pressure. Just chill.  The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.”   
― **Socrates** You are not alone. Here, if [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92Hf_Dm-HiY) makes you feel better :) An important thing to remember, I think, is that not everybody who offers opinions on a subject is an expert, or even moderately knowledgeable. Most people comment on things with only a rudimentary understanding of what’s going on- hence we have so much misinformation floating around. It’s easy to feel as though you don’t know anything compared to the scholars on the internet who seem to have swallowed the encyclopedia brittanica whole, but remember that’s usually not the case. 

Also, like someone else said, knowing things is easy, as long as you make an active effort. Join the world news sub. Read a newspaper. Educate yourself through the internet. The good thing about this generation is that information is only a click away. But keep in mind, most accounts of events, whether current or historical, come heavily biased, so steer clear of forming any concrete views based on one piece of information.

Also also, find what interests you, and the information will come to you naturally! When we first started dating, I was supremely in awe of my ex because he knew so much about engineering and technology and politics. I got caught up trying to overload myself on those topics before realizing that I knew just as much as he did, except about history and literature and architecture. While it’s great to have a basic understanding of everything, don’t feel obligated to know everything about the topics you don’t enjoy. Same feeling just read books and newspaper, 

honestly reading newspaper is also quite fine 

you'll soon see yourself having an opinion as well I have legitimately never seen someone here who was accurately informed about something here,  been lurking a long time.  It's just rabid and opinionated people.  People here make a lot of fun of Quora,  but it is far far better than Reddit in terms of getting information / explanation.  Specifically about politics. Follow subreddit like r/truereddit I've been using Reddit for only an year and it seems i know more about the US political scene than the Indian one... lol. I spend hours and hours of my day, everyday to learn about a variety of stuffs other than the ones I'm already well versed at.

It just takes the will dude. You have to love doing it. I'm no special than you. 

That and ignore the r/iamverysmart and r/thathappened jackasses. It's people like them is why Reddit has become a cesspool of misinformation which drives away  real discussion.

A few years back if you had a well informed but controversial opinion, people discussed and debated you before coming to a conclusion. Now they just downvote you and link to those subs and kill and discussion.

Case in point: yesterday a guy said on this sub that he doesn't know Thanos. He's a very active Redditor which means he spends a fuck ton of time on the internet. If he didn't hear about the biggest movie villain of this decade it just feels weird because the net is full of memes and jokes and references.


I just pointed that out and got downvoted to Oblivion. Fuckers never even stopped and thought that you would have to be living under a mountain to not hear about the movie event of the century. You should visit the LNRDTs. That's where you'll see the real randia. I think we've got more opinions than information actually Is this thread a joke? All of us are passionate about something. I am sure you are too.",2019-08-18 23:42:00
Politics,Work hard so you don’t depend on my name in 2024: PM Narendra Modi to MPs,coikdp,https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1160049382986788864?s=19,," Is this a hint that he won't seek a third term? That Gambhir pic is so apt!  Take a moment to digest that this guy stepped in the scene 4 months before elections, was up against Atishi Marlena whose been doing kickass job at ground level for the past few years and he still won;  
He still fucking won. Modiji will fight next US Presidential elections against Trump Is he implying that BJP workers dont actually work hard themselves and only win in elections cuz of MODI’s name? Ha. 

Eat that Indian voters. You voted for name and not for work. straight from the horse's mouth. We should elect Gambhir as the next PM then IK and Gambhir can fight it out in the field. Good lesson and show your work not my name in your pamphlets GG for PM in '24? People thought 2019 was peak India. Wait till 2024. That is the abyss. If the right-wing still come to power *after* Modi, then it's really time to emigrate. What if he's sick I don't think it will matter. There is no strong competitor to the bjp at the moment.  Shah for PM confirmed.... Given the steps Narendra Modi has started to take in his second term, voters, even those who had swayed from him 2019 (chances of which are quite less considering his increased vote % this time), will vote en masse for him in 2024 if he decides to contest as BJP's PM candidate once again.

Only one Parliamentary session has passed and his govt. has got passed many crucial bills like Triple Talaq, Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, NIA Bill etc. and above all, scrapping of Article 370 and Jammu-Kashmir Reorganization Bill which no one had imagined. In the upcoming session, he is planning to move anti-conversion Bill. With actions like these, I don't think that BJP candidates will have to work hard to garner votes. Modi will have already done his job by then. You also work hard so that you don't have to depend on riots or soldiers.",2019-08-11 03:45:53
Politics,What should I do to not get depressed from the toxic political news?,d002d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d002d5/what_should_i_do_to_not_get_depressed_from_the/,"TV debates, social media feeds and YouTube comment sections are filled with this vile political rhetoric. They end up making me upset and depressed about the political landscape of this country. 

Maybe I'm just another liberal snowflake, but following the news is getting too hard for me. I lose it especially when people start justifying human rights abuse or lynchings. And these hate comments about Mahatma Gandhi have gone up lately on Twitter and Instagram.

Should I just stop consuming political news and videos all together? Can't see any other way to escape this noise. How do you guys manage to not get politically depressed?"," Yes, if it is actually hurting your mental wellbeing, avoid news channels, and curate your sns withing an inch of its life. Go back to the old habit of reading newspapers, an actual paper one. That way your brain gets time to absorb the news in long format, you get time to form an opinion without being distacted by what others are saying. And you also get to read opeds and editorials along with other articles without the constant hum of kneejerk comments. Stay away from Twitter for a while. However this toxic environment should make you strong. You will feel low for sometime. However in the long run you would be a more determined person.
The world around us is not perfect, but it's not changed by ostrich who hide their heads in sand. We need to do our part to make it better if not perfect.
Also follow the mademesmile subreddit. It helps. Real time news is cancerous. Stop going to Twitter, YouTube, tv channels etc. Also, looking at other people's reactions influences your views and doesn't let you objectively process the news. 

I'm a big fan of newspapers for this reason. Since it's a one big summary of daily events, the articles are much more thought-out and the tone is to inform rather than instigate. Also there are no reactions from a million people to the event for you to process. It keeps you informed, let's you process the news and come to your own conclusion. 

A good opinion piece on NY times for it: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/technology/two-months-news-newspapers.html Raise your voice. Find an outlet. Dont let it rot within you, speak it out or write it down. I've been trying to do the same. Will start a website/blog soon. Media sells the content that gets your attention. Negative stories are better at it than positive stories.

Here's what I do:

1- I used to use [news.google.com](https://news.google.com) for news. But now I have blocked that site on the router. Political news absolutely generates anxiety.

2- I don't use twitter, facebook, instagram. Their only goal is to keep you online as long as they can. Pretty manipulative.

3- uninstall youtube app from mobile. Laptop is fine.

4- Maintain youtube feed. You have to make sure that you do not watch political crap on your main logged in account. Keep it pure; only use it to watch quality content related to your hobbies / interests or light non controversial youtubers. And tell youtube to not recommend news related stuff. And obviously unsubscribe from a channel which uploads that stuff.

5- If you sometime just want to watch political stuff, open that in private browsing. What this does is, your accounts don't get personalized by google, youtube. Otherwise you'll keep seeing same and same content. And you tend to click on that poisonous content because it confirms your world-view even more.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day. News is not a necessary thing to survive. My life would not change a bit if I had no idea what happened in Kashmir. Developed thick skin and it definitely helps me. Don't use social media. Fuck FB, fuck Twitter, fuck news subreddits of Reddit (get an alt account without any political/country sub subbed). Fuck TV.

Watch a non-political web/tv series. Read books.


This will go away. Take a break from all political news and anything else that keeps to distracted, but makes you wonder what the hell just happened to your time. Do this for a couple of weeks minimum, I'd  suggest a month. 

May be try reading a fiction book (non-political) or spend time with any other hobby/interests you may have.

You'll be surprised by:

* how not being up to date with news has close to 0 impact in your life
* how much you enjoy other activities/hobbies
* how you can actually change the world by talking to people instead of just reading opinions online which does nothing


Once your break is done and you're ready to go back, start with newspapers then may be a news app like livemint or indianexpress.com or whatever you prefer. Do not use social media as a source of news. Do not use news aggregators like inshorts, Google news. **Ignorance is Bliss -** Me(6th Sep,2019) [Avoid news.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17640820) Because it does not matter. You will still have to earn and make a living whether it is BJP or any other party. No one cares about depression in this country. That is the harsh truth. Nothing will change. Maybe try to get a mental health checkup done if YouTube comments rile you up to the point of depression lmao",2019-09-06 01:50:27
Politics,Gandhi family skips Pranab Mukherjee's Bharat Ratna award function.,cnxuh9,https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/gandhi-family-skips-pranab-mukherjees-bharat-ratna-award-function20190808230140/,," This is the reason Modi won.  First, sidelining a prominent leader and making him president and now skipping his Bharat Ratna ceremony.

Why would a person join Congress when he sees how non-gandhi members are treated??  Like there's no scope of becoming the prime minister or even the president of INC unless you worship the Gandhi family.

At the time when this country needs a strong opposition, we're stuck with this sham of a party and people like Rahul Gandhi who are so cutoff from the people of the nation that it's not even funny. Oh well. They treat anyone non-Gandhi like trash and then expect to win. That’s hypocritical [deleted] Congress will perish. They are doomed. The worst thing is no other regional party seems to take congress' place, we need someone competing with BJP. It's disgusting how Congress treats some of their great party workers as a Trash just because they're not ""gandhis"". They are upset that Pranab got the Bharat Ratna before Rahul Time for Congress to Die... really need better alternative. INC leaders should leave behind this petty politics and show some respect to their former members instead of worshipping Gandhis. Since those seats were empty, they could have invited me.
The lunch/dinner was AWESOME! Pranab da should've been the PM. Things like this don’t bring them any favors. When they need those favors, badly. 

Even though I don’t think Pranabda deserves Bharat Ratna because what both his terms as FM were worst economic periods for India. 

And also disagree with Bharat Ratna for Nanaji Deshmukh. Well With this type of attitude i don't congress will come into power I think it is humiliating, mainly for Nehru family but slightly for Pranab Mukharjee too. But is it as simple as 'Congress hates non- Gandhi leaders '? Pranab Mukharjee was giving subtle support for BJP since a few years. He even went to RSS headquarters and gave a speech. Civil War inside Congress Party Last year he praised RSS that explains why he got Bharat Ratan and I don't see anything he has contributed to India that can be praised at International community. Pranab is a great politician and he really deserve Bharat Ratna! The Bharat Ratna has turned into an overtly political award anyway. Doesn't mean shit. Mummyyyyy mujhe nahi jaaaanaaa!!! 😭 He is an RSS pawn now openly, no need to give him any more dignity. Man at the end he goes on to handshake all the BJP members only. And all of the 3 that get award he is the only one who goes on to shake hand. So it's pretty clear which side he is on now. And As if yashwant Shina was given respect by BJP after he left. Good. Pranab Mukherjee was one of the worst things to happen to this country. This r/politics but bhakt version",2019-08-09 18:52:53
Politics,Who agrees with me that we need a new party that can agree on the ideologies of both left and the right,d1c08q,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d1c08q/who_agrees_with_me_that_we_need_a_new_party_that/,"I have been thinking about it for a while and what I can foresee, the right wing is going to reign supreme for a long time now. And the opposition, the left wing has crumbled down because of it's corrupted incompetency and bad leadership qualities of Rahul Gandhi. People have lost faith in the left and the craze of modi is justified. We can argue if he's a good politician or not but there's no doubt that he is a great politician. The right wing is pro-nationalist and nationalism can be used as a tool by some to invoke radicalism and eventually, fascism. I am not being paranoid but I am concerned this can be the case when I see media channels constantly spreading biased news and fake nationalism. I think a strong party of youth that does not get biased or lean towards a particular ideology but only works for the welfare of the people of India. The presence of some form of opposition is needed to dilute some of the extreme ideologies of right wing and the left wing is incapable to do that. But that's just my opinion."," From what I realise, the left-right system of government is not very well understood by the general public of India. 

I’m gonna give you 3 examples-

1. My father doesn’t like BJP and my mother just loves Modi and they’re mostly active in politics. But both of them have no idea about Left or Right .

2. I went to dinner at a friend’s house whose father is a member of BJP and he himself didn’t know his party was right leaning or what conservative meant. When I asked him about his policies he just told me some simple ones like water sanitation and nothing else (tbh it was all in fun and jest, I didn’t want him to feel attacked and he didn’t mind simple questions).

3. I’m in MBBS 3rd year and one of our teachers in Community Medicine is a modi fan and one day he legit mentioned that ‘BJP is liberal as we call it in America’ and went on to explain 2 party system in America with many mistakes (I need to pass so I didn’t say anything).

Truthfully the points you make are good but I don’t think India generally understands left-right or conservative-liberal. Most general population looks at how much a government did. This is where I think Indian politics differs from American. 

BJP’s biggest plus point that they have used these 8 years has been ‘Congress did nothing for 60 years, we did so much in 4’. And it worked. For better or worse Modi always knew the first step in solving a problem except most of the times he doesn’t know the second. 

We need a party with liberal values containing some policies from the other side but they need to be presentable as working. There is no difference between ideologies of the Congress and BJP and anyone else. There isn't much difference between economical policies of any political party in India. The implementation also depends on who is in charge how urgently they need to get it done. Each one only differs in the way they have carved out votes based on religion, caste, language, occupation etc.


Ideology is not an issue in a country's development but division of power is. The best growth and development this country has seen was during times of minority and coalition govts because they were forced to share the power. If anything we need a political party which will agree to share power with rest of the govt such as RBI, CBI and EC. I don't understand much about ideologies but the amount of effort you've put in, you've my full support AAP might be the solution I agree. I support subsidised healthcare and redistribution of land. On the other hand, I think loan waivers for corporations and farmers incentivise taking bad loans. As a person, why would I even want to pay back loans if the next government is just going to get rid of my liabilities?

I support enough taxation to get us free education and subsidised healthcare, but don't support ridiculous import taxes on electronics and other goods. I also want farmers to pay income tax like anyone else and not be forced to sell their producer at government sanctioned mandis only.

Consequently, my choice of parties is quite limited because it seems like all they want to do is promise freebies just to get elected. Really wish we had more rational economic policies. I don't think politicians can legally own any media house but if they do, that media house should be sealed right now! Would you agree with this description of left-wing/right-wing?

Some left-wing positions: healthcare and education should be taken care of by the state especially for the poor, higher taxes for the rich to pay for welfare programs, markets should be heavily regulated, personal freedoms (freedom of expression). 

Some right-wing positions: free markets with minimal or no regulation, low amount of taxation, social conservatism

&#x200B;

I agree with you when you say that we don't have a competent opposition today. Silencing criticism by calling it  ""anti-national"" is a dangerous trend.

Have you thought of voting for independent candidates or parties other INC/BJP, when they present a reasonably coherent and sensible manifesto? I did that in General Elections 2019: voted for an new party. They lost but secured the third highest number of votes in my Lok Sabha constituency, just behind the big two. Securing a large number of votes is a source of encouragement for the candidate/party. It tells them that they're manifesto appealed to a section of the voters. They might work harder during the next local/state/national elections.",2019-09-09 04:32:52
Politics,How do we deal with the growing fundamentalism in our country?,cyl264,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cyl264/how_do_we_deal_with_the_growing_fundamentalism_in/,"I have had lots of discussions lately with friends and colleagues. Regarding Kashmir, regarding the ongoing NRC process, and the general political climate in our country. These conversations have left a bitter taste in the mouth for me.

A lot of people - people who are generally nice, kind, and reasonable - are increasingly seeing gross violations of human right as acceptable in the ""interest of the nation."" Some things that would have been severely looked down upon if said 4-5 years ago are a part of casual conversations. Normal, well-educated people are now openly saying that it is okay to discriminate against people because of their religion. The more I think about it, the more depressed I feel about the state of things.

My question is this: how do we deal with this? This sudden shift in the general public conscience is not going to go away on its own. My personal experience has been that most attempts to counter this new line of reasoning only results in people getting defensive and deeper ingrained in their own prejudices. How do we counter this? How do we empathize with the position that these people are coming from and make them see that there is an alternative way of seeing things?"," It's good that you think over these situations. Let me tell you this, it isn't new. These feelings were always there. Communalism of this kind always persisted pre independence and post independence as well. It is now in the open partly because of the information age. Growing up we are all taught this ""oh they are not like us, they are different people with different set of values"". When such thoughts are ingrained in our upbringing how do you expect habits to change by any amount of argument. These sentiments have now got a voice with political representation. Infact at many places this is the acceptable line of thought.
I come from a place where i grew up among the elite sections of the society. My father was always introduced as ""aree ye un musalmano jaise nahi hai"". I always thought this was an acceptable line of thought. Now when i look back and think over it, i have just respect for my father. He heard it all, accepted it all just so that we get accepted by the society even though we had a different set of identity.
Is this India of my dreams? My Incredible India is lost somewhere... my hindu friend is very vocal about how entirely incompetent our current government is. she regularly puts up stories criticising the failures of government. when she put up the stories about kashmir, though, all hell broke loose. so many people of her own family berated her. her ""friend"" said that 'you shouldn't criticise modiji, i agree that hindus are benefiting but don't criticise him'. just typing this out makes me feel physically sick. how can people be so blindly trusting of a man who time and again has fucked over the economy is simply baffling to me. at this point, i really do wish i could somehow leave india. i cannot bear to stay here any longer. The only way I see it is if the opposition gets stronger, more organised and starts speaking up for real issues or if people decide to start a revolution against the corruption that is so inbred at all levels of politics and governance. It did not shift suddenly, it's just that we hear a lot of them more thanks to technology. The situation seems to be actually improving albeit very slowly. Its not growing.  Believe it or not, its decreasing.  People everywhere are more secular, more accepting, and as they become more educated and exposed to information, the trend will only accelerate.

Consider the people on reddit, for instance.  The majority are liberal.  More importantly,  even the ones who come in bigoted often quickly see the other side and change their views.

People have been killing each other in the name of religion for centuries in India.  They have treated each other badly.  Muslims and Hindus have been at each other's throats for 500 years, as have Hindus and Christians.  It wasn't too long ago that we had the holocaust called the partition.

What is happening is that thanks to all the free flow of information, increasingly acts of stupidity are being noted, reported on and, made public.  You get to hear more of them than in the past. These will give joy to a small number of bad people, but a greater number will be repelled and not want to be associated with it.

We do have a local uptick of bigotry, thanks to Modi and his bhakts, but Im convinced this is a short-lived bump. No trend in history is monotonic, and these people will likely *accelerate* the trend to liberalism.
The hindutavadis of India have made my ultra-religious bigoted parents start to change their views -- in their 70s.  They don't want to be associated with the hate.  They haven't gotten as far as I'd like them to be, but 10 years ago a muslim or christian wouldn't be allowed in their kitchen or puja room;  now the muslim driver they've ""adopted"" spends his time there. Youre not to be afforded any protection just because you belong to a particular religion is all i take it to mean.

Fun fact. Human rights dont exist. You get to have what others are willing to give you. Follow what society prescribes, modulate according to inner moralities, keep calm and carry on. You can't. It's too late. The government is fascist and can't take any criticism. It's not a democracy anymore. I feel bad for you Muslims in India. There's honestly no place for you in that country, and if you think there is then you're just kidding yourself. This entire Hindu supremacist movement that Modi has ignited will not go away any time soon; in fact, what you're seeing right now is the growth of it. The true sentiments of the Hindu population is starting to arise because they feel more comfortable than ever before to voice their hatred. Similar to how white supremacists view Trump. I mean, they call it HINDUstan for a reason. As long as your allegiance lies with new Delhi, do fuckall.",2019-09-02 19:23:43
Politics,"Discontent, dissent & defiance in Congress as Gandhi family begins to lose grip on party",cziok2,https://theprint.in/politics/discontent-dissent-defiance-in-congress-as-gandhi-family-begins-to-lose-grip-on-party/286169/,," > What is more alarming for the Congress high command is what veterans see as the first signs of rebellion from the party’s prominent young faces — Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh, Milind Deora in Maharashtra, Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan, Deepender Hooda in Haryana and Jitin Prasada in Uttar Pradesh, to name a few.

This is funny as the ""rebellion"" is against the ""old guard"" of the Congress. As is the democratic Congress culture, they are playing politics to assert their own place in the party. The author tries to paint it as a rebellion against the Gandhi family when the real truth is that they have the tacit support of Rahul Gandhi in this. > Deora, claim Maharashtra Congress leaders, has been “in touch” with the BJP and is preparing to jump ship. He didn’t respond to calls and text messages from ThePrint about these claims.

Rumour mongering. Thewebdev baksh de mujhe > These young leaders chose to go public with their dissent against the party line on Article 370 ...

The official party line is that they support the eventual repeal of Article 370 but do not support the undemocratic and unconstitutional way the current government has done it. So support for repealing Article 370 by any Congress leader is just a reiteration of the party stand and is not some ""rebellion"" against the party or the leadership. > According to experts, the inability of leaders to see a politically viable future for themselves in the party coupled with the leadership crisis since Rahul’s resignation has encouraged them to speak their minds.

This I agree with. Rahul Gandhi's resignation and the inability of the Congress leadership to address this effectively certainly has created a perception of leadership vacuum and caused morale to fall. However, they still believe only in the Gandhis to deliver on this too. First when the Gandhis were in absolute control, people had problem. Now they're losing control, people have problem. Gandhis kare to kare kya? > Scindia and Pilot have been sulking since they were denied chief ministership of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan last December.

I am sure they were disappointed. But again, they have no plans to leave the Congress for it and are being quite active rather than ""sulking"".

> Pilot recently hit out at Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s failure to prevent the closure of the Pehlu Khan case, where the accused were acquitted. 

Again, normal congress politics at work. There are many in the Congress who thinks this sensitive matter was not paid due attention by the government.

> Scindia’s supporters in the party have been attacking Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath and senior leader Digvijaya Singh and have even threatened to resign if the party’s reins are not handed over to the former Guna MP.

Again, normal Congress politics at work. **The author mistakes democratic dissent as a ""rebellion"".** > Five Congress MLAs in Maharashtra have already resigned from the party and over half-a-dozen more are negotiating with the BJP, a senior state Congress functionary told ThePrint ... There are similar reports from the other poll-bound states of Jharkhand and Haryana 

Nothing new here. Before any election, BJP under Amit Shah is known to open its coffers and / or use state agencies to entice opposition party leaders to join it. > 10, Janpath, Sonia Gandhi’s residence, used to be the first port of call for any party chief minister visiting Delhi. One of them recently spent a couple of days in the national capital but left without even seeking an appointment with her, confided a Congress leader, blaming it on Rahul’s “condescending behaviour” with his party colleagues.

Disgruntled congress worker who didn't get an appointment to meet Sonia Gandhi blames Rahul Gandhi for it. Obviously that happens a lot as the party President cannot meet everyone who desires to meet him / her and sometimes deliberately doesn't to send a message. > When Rahul Gandhi, the former party president who is likely to return to the helm sooner rather than later, was at the receiving end of the BJP for questioning normalcy in Kashmir, which Pakistan used in its petition to the United Nations, few party colleagues came out to endorse his stand.

An outright lie - even Shashi Tharoor has made a public statement endorsing Rahul Gandhi's statement and supporting him. > After Rahul offered his resignation at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, party leaders remained silent for a day, until social media was abuzz with talk of everyone in the Congress wanting him to go. 

Again, just a lie. The party which was partly responsible for our independence now in shatters because of an incompetent mother-son duo, defeated by a party who idolizes someone who wrote mercy petitions to the British. Ah, time is cruel, isn't it? > Prasada has been repeatedly contradicting the party line, first supporting the NDA government on its Article 370 move and then echoing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s suggestion for population control. 

The official party line is that they support the eventual repeal of 370. The Congress also support population control. So these are not really an endorsement for Modi *kaka* but a reiteration of the party line. Nor does it indicate any ""rebellion"". > Kidwai has a different take again. ***“I think it is because of Sonia Gandhi that the party has been able to hold it together. Despite talk about many leaders quitting the party, we haven’t seen a single leader exit since she took over,”*** he said.

> ... Sonia’s presence has quelled the dissatisfaction of the leaders, said Kidwai, as they felt they would at least get a patient hearing. ***“It’s fashionable to criticise the Gandhis,”*** Kidwai said. “But the party needs to introspect and look within, many of its leaders haven’t risen to the occasion when needed.”

Politics,101 opposition members join BJP in 3 months,cqel1i,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8tEzcmMYts,," Political affiliation is a joke in India. I don't understand how a left leaning or right leaning politicians can easily hop parties by leaving all their core values behind. 

This shows how politically illiterate these people are and are just in for their personal benefits and dont give a fuck about the people or the nation. If the opposition were actually serious to start a movement against this public murder of democracy by the power-that-be, they'd use this as an opportunity to identify the saboteurs and ban them from the party once and for all.

With each of these defectors joining the BJP, my respect for the opposition grows; those who still choose to stay are actually committed to their core values and believe in it even if the world goes crazy over dictators. Heading towards one nation , one party scenario 😅 Mass recruiter... Sabka messiah... Mass recruiter... Sabka messiah that's scary What's new? Politicians will sell their souls for power and if they see one side is becoming the dominant party then they will go join that party whatever conflict of interest and values be damned.

Edit: my first silver! Thank you my good sir! For those of you unaware about what’s going on. It’s a festival celebrated around Telangana & Andhra Pradesh(?) and named as “Bonalu”. 

There’s an interesting story behind its celebration and related to pre-colonial era of long-stretched famines and droughts in the Deccan region. I wish I could tell you more but I’m not a native and know about it only from friends and experience living in Hyderabad for the past 7 years. 

If you know more about it, definitely enlighten me. I would be glad. Bonalu is a Hindu Festival where Goddess Mahakali is worshiped. It is an annual festival celebrated in the twin Cities Hyderabad and Secunderabad and other parts of Telangana state, India.

Bonalu is celebrated usually during Ashada Masam that falls in July/August. Special poojas are performed for goddess Yellamma during the first and last day of the festival. The festival is considered as a form of thanksgiving to the Goddess after the fulfillment of vows. Bonam literally means Meal in Telugu, which is an offering to the Mother Goddess. Women folk in household prepare rice that is cooked along with Milk, Jaggery in a New Earthen or Brass Pot, which is adorned with Neem Leaves, Turmeric and Vermilion. Women carry these pots on their heads and make an offering of Bonam, including Bangles and Saree to the Mother Goddess at Temples. Bonalu involves worship of Kali in her various forms such Mysamma, Pochamma, Yellamma, Dokkalamma, Pedamma, Poleramma, Ankalamma, Maremma, Nookalamma etc.

Bonalu festival -Origin 
The festival history reportedly started in 1813 in the region of Hyderabad & Secunderabad when plague disease had broken out in Twin Cities that had claimed thousands of lives. A military battalion from Hyderabad was then deployed to Ujjain and concerned about the plague menace in Hyderabad the military battalion offered prayers to Mother Goddess at Mahankaali Temple in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, that if people get relived from the epidemic they would be installing the idol of Mahankaali back in Secunderabad. It is believed by devotees that Mahankaali halted the spread of the disease while the Military Battalion came back here & installed an idol by offering Bonalu to Mother Mahankaali.

**The Ritual** 
Bonalu is celebrated across various parts of the city. During the first Sunday of Aashaadam, celebrations begin at Golconda Fort followed by Ujjaini Mahakali Temple in Secunderabad and Balkampet Yellamma temple in Balkampet on second Sunday, and the third Sunday, at the Pochamma and Katta maisamma temple near Chilkalguda and the Matheswari temple of Lal Darwaza in Old City of Hyderabad. Other temples such as Akkanna Madanna temple in Haribowli, Muthyalamma temple in Shah Ali Banda are the popular venues where Bonalu is celebrated. Lakhs of devotees throng the temples to pay obeisance to Mahankaali. 

Women dress up in the traditional Sari along with jewels and other accessories during the occasion. Teenage Girls adorn Half-Sarees along with jewels to reflect the traditional grace of the attire. Some women face a spell of trace where they dance with the balancing pots to the rhythmic beats made by drums in honor of the Goddess. 

The festival begins at Golconda, Women who carry Bonalu are believed to possessing the spirit of Mother Goddess, and when they approach temple, people sprinkle water on their feet in order to pacify the spirit, which is believed to be aggressive. Devotees offer Thottelu. These are small, colorful paper structures, which are supported by sticks and offered as a token of respect.

**Pothuraju** 
Pothuraju, considered the brother of Mother Goddess, is represented by a bare-bodied and well-built man, who wears a small tightly draped red dhoti and bells near ankles, and applies turmeric on his body, including vermilion on his forehead. Pothuraju dances to the resounding drums and dances close to Palaharam Bandi, the procession.

**The Feast** 
Bonalu is a festival where there is a divine offering to Mother Goddess and families also share these offerings with other family members and guests.

**Rangam** 
Rangam, or the Performing the Oracle, is held after the next morning of the actual festival. A Woman invokes goddess Mahankaali onto herself and performs this custom. She foretells the next year ahead when devotees ask for information about future.

**Ghatam** 
Ghatam implies a copper pot, which is decorated in the form of mother goddess and carried by a priest, adorning a traditional dhoti and his body completely smeared in turmeric. The Ghatam is taken as a procession from first day of the festival to the last day, when it is immersed in water. The Ghatam accompanies drums. 

Usually Ghatam of Akkanna Madanna Temple in Haribowli actually leads the procession, placed on an elephant inturn accompanied by mounted horses and models, which depict Akkanna and Madanna. It ends as a glittering procession in the evening after immersion of Ghatams at Nayapul. Ghatams from other popular temples of Mahakali in twin cities congregate here.

It is carnival filled with music, lights, dance, and alcohol.  Everyone in the streets, drunk, dancing, and singing.

An experience of a lifetime. the guy instantly changes his expression once he knew he was caught video taping. This how life hits me vs how I react🤦🏻‍♂️ History behind bonalu festival (from wikipedia)

>The history of the origin of this festival traces back to the 18th Century, and is linked with the ""Regimental Bazaar"" and the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. In the year 1813, plague disease broke out in the twin cities, and this took away the lives of thousands of people. Just before this, a military battalion from Hyderabad was deployed to Ujjain. When this Hyderabadian Military Battalion got to know about the epidemic in the cities, they prayed to the Mother Goddess in Mahankaal Temple - Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. History tells us, that this military battalion prayed to Goddess Mahankaali, to kill the plague, and if the Goddess would do so, they had decided to install an idol of the Goddess Mahankaali in the city. It is believed that Mahankaali destroyed the disease and kept the pestilence away. Then, the military battalion returned to the city and installed an idol of the goddess, which was followed by the offering of Bonalu to her. Hence, from then, this became a tradition, which has been followed and is still being followed by most of the people of Telangana.

>Other versions also include the mythological story and belief that revolves around the festival, says that this is the time when Goddess Mahakali comes back to her parental home, in Ashada Maasam or the period from late June to August, and so, this period is the most optimal time to offer Bonalu to the goddess. This can be compared to the treatment of a girl, who is married, and then returns to her birthplace, and is pampered by her parents.

The person you see in the video is dressed up as pothuraaju. Pothuraaju is also a god and is the only brother of 10 (?) sister-goddesses. He usually carries this huge whip and it is actually considered as a blessing if you are hit with it. But usually they hit only lightly as a formality. Don't know why in the video he hits so hard. shivji ka prasad. LMAO That ass is BLESSED!

Does individual channel cost of a-la-carte varies with operator.? 

Ex. lets say  some xyz channel cost is set at M.R.P Rs. 15.

Weather this cost is same across all dth  service providers  like TATA Sky, Airtel, Videocon etc., or the service provider set their own discount price to attract customer like  Airtel - Rs. 10, Tata - Rs. 12, Videocon - Rs.15.

If price differs with operator then, which DTH operator has the cheapest a-la-carte channel? Leading a branch team in the college I studied was and unfortunately remains a stressful thing.

Politics,What can we do? What should a common man do?,chylty,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/chylty/what_can_we_do_what_should_a_common_man_do/,"With all the dangerous bills being passed (Undermining RTI, Ability to name an individual as terrorist, UP Private universities being restricted from holding ""anti-national"" activities and likely many more in the pipeline) and with all stupid shit that is being propogated (Go to moon if you are against 'Jai Shri Ram', Astrology is the best science of the world, Peacock reproduces with tears, There was internet during Mahabharat, There was plastic surgery, Gravitational waves should be called Modi waves and of course many many more), what can a common man do?

Ranting on twitter/reddit/facebook doesn't seem to do anything. In my opinion, violent protests on streets is not an option. For some reason, voting is not being used as a weapon against this. Considering the fact that all the youth is busy in 9-5 jobs, cricket, bollywood, big boss, what do you think is the best way to act?

Surely, there is a need for a revolution. With BJP in majority in Lok Sabha and to be majority in Rajya Sabha, congress in disarray, opposition is virtually non-existent. Media doesn't do shit. 

We need to start a revolution, but what, how, when and where!!?"," Isn't it weird that Hong Kong people - despite being only 7 million strong, despite staring at an inevitable future inside an oppressive wealthy powerful giant,  despite having no prominent leadership or opposition party - still turned out in such numbers with so much determination for so long, sacrificing their normal lives and comforts. And all that for just one law that doesn't even affect most of them.

In contrast, India's institutions and laws that directly benefit citizens are falling like bowling pins one after another, but there hasn't been even one civil society protest. Civil society and civil society leadership seem nonexistent in India. A few groups are fighting via the courts, but for some strange reason, they never seem to approach people for moral or financial support. I wonder what the emergency might have felt like... I say, we keeping fighting. We must challenge, question and criticize the government on all platforms online and offline but in a manner that doesn't endanger our personal safety. It's a difficult and thankless job but I think eventually we will win. We won't be able to build a secular society in a day and it is natural to face opposition along the way. So don't lose hope, and keep fighting the good fight. Resist and keep up our narrative alive. They will get their way because they have the numbers. But as long as we keep speaking, we are doing our job. 

Is it enough? No. But we aren't capable of doing what is enough right now. Every nation has this boom-bust cycle even in social ideology. Imagine being born in Europe in the 1890s decade. First world war when you are 20, second one when you're 40, and if you survived, living on aid from US and UK till you die. All because the right wing extremism saw its flow. 

So, we resist and wait for this flow to end and ebb to begin. I'm optimistic that we'll see the light sooner or later. Before starting a revolution against the authoritarian government, we need to revolt against the regime which is established in our own households.

The ideology to not question the higher authority and follow the orders is planted by our very own parents. Years of psychological suppression won't be so easy to overcome. I know many people who voted for BJP because their parents asked them to. I have had countless arguments with my relatives on their extremist hindu ideology but every argument ends with my parents telling me to be respectful towards my elders.

-Franklin D. Roosevelt It's just going to be worse. In next election whether it is state / central or municipal election throw them out. 1. Change your name legally to Sharma Mishra or   Joshi Pandey or similar.
2. Do not marry or have kids so you dont have to see loved ones suffer.
3. Change your phone number every 6 months.
4. Dont stay in one job or one rented place for more than a year.
5. Take a vacation every year to the same foreign spot - be it nepal or malaysia or australia. Build connections.
6. Apply for emigration to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and USA.
7. Invest only in foreign assets either through mutual funds, NASDAQ ETF or via opening a foreign bank account and investing through it.
8. As soon as you can, buy some property abroad ..be it nepal or USA. 
9. Dont read news, worry about politics or others. Keep your head down but discriminate against bhakts and help the underprivileged, by donating, hiring or giving them your business.
10. Find the smallest unit of politics around you... and get involved ...local club or local walking group etc.
11. Dont drink, smoke, gamble etc...save your money and work hard....two jobs if need be.... in 10 yrs you will have enough to leave this country. Most realistic answer after emigration: Start a business. Take risks, gather money, gain power and clout and start pushing against policies in industry forums and municipals. Let's mass emigrate out of this shit hole of a country. As an individual if we can change ourself maybe that's the revolution we need. That is the only option left  The plot of ""Watchdogs: Legion"" is starting to look very much a potential possibility. Recognize the importance of these rights and vote for the right people. But if people vote for Gautam Gambhir over Atishi or for Sunny fucking Deol then they have this coming to them. Emigrate(if you can) Change country tbh. BJP has united hindus. From dalits to obc to brahmins all vote for BJP as hindus.

Check this out I guess all one can do it continue to act in their personal capacity(without getting lynched) support similar voices wherever and whenever possible and hope for the collective effort to eventually reach a critical mass before the point of no-return. I'm afraid the common man that voted for hindutva fascism is not going to wake up until he himself is forced to face the music. The Central govt.wants to wash off its hands with as many social responsibilities as possible. Most of the elected people's representatives are not educationists/academicians/scientists or technocrats. Most of them are advocates, who doesn't understand about many sectors, including education.
Most of the state govt.s are run by persons to whom education has no value,as they themselves are not educated.
India doesn't have a civil society,as their probable members would be from the middle class - & they are totally careless about this aspect of an arm of Indian development. For them- education is not a priority.
That leaves the media. Again education alone can't be the bread & butter for media & most of them are privately run. So the lesser the educated, better will be their chances of business - as they can easily fool people.
That leaves the retired persons in the arena. If the learned takes up this cause, at least some salvaging can be done - other wise it's every one for himself. There are NGOs and people who are fighting. There are just levels of how you can help. You can either be the social worker who devotes his/her entire time (e.g. Narendra Dabolkar) to fight the system; or you decide your job is in the area where you want to make a difference ( e.g. education, defense, lawyer, IPS, IAS, IFS, politician) OR you contact an NGO and take up a cause ( even if it is just one court case) and help in your free time. It can be overwhelming to look at the big picture, but if you want to contribute, it must be one tiny action at a time. You can do it, we just need to focus on one action that we feel passionate about. e.g. I feel passionate about education policy, so I will look for organizations/people that are doing good and see what I can do to help. Or, I am angry with corrupt politicians taking over forest land -> look for organizations who have filed court cases against them. Believe me, there are many. We just need to make the effort and look. I believe that this is the only way, rather than mobilizing the masses against someone that the majority voted for. Am I the only one who is thinking of becoming a full stack web dev to go abroad even when I have no experience and interest in Maths, Data Structures and Engineering? be like ambani .

before bjp came , everybody was claiming him to be congress guy , but after bjp hes the biggest gainer from bjp.

see how you can game the system Focus on police reforms and judicial reforms, RTI is for big people like journalists and often the data received from RTI   is used for sensationalism..   


If you have want a safe and secure society, police reforms will pave the way. Good luck. AI was hidden in mantras bro how could you forget that? Start a personal revolution. Make friends and become powerful. Not in a thug like manner. Learn to change your environment with the small things first. The things that are in your control. Improve your condition bit by bit but consistently. Revolution doesn't make sense unless you want to overthrow democratically elected government ? Is that what you want to do.

Best way is to politely educate people on why you think India deserves different leader. You need to be vocal about sensible issues like government raising taxes and causing panic among FPI and shut up about idiotic comments from Drump. That's what the anti-fascists are doing in the west. I don't see a sudden revolution happening in our country. We should be ready for a long, slow and multilayered approach to bring about the changes in our society.

Despite the reprehensible ideology of RSS, one thing that I admire about them is their network of volunteers spreading their agenda of hatred so efficiently like viruses. Ultimately, this is an ideological war. If we want to win this war, we need to spread our ideology. Perhaps we need a grass-root movement, and perhaps we need to replicate this concept of morning meetings in 'Shakhas', where we can educate youths about the idea of a liberal and secular India.

Also, we urgently need judicial and police reforms. Rich and connected today can flout all the laws without any consequences. Crores of cases are pending. Often it takes decades, for a judgement to be delivered. Litigants often die before judgements are pronounced in their cases. Unfortunately, these important points are not election issues. If elections can be won in the name of religion, caste arithmetic and pseudo-nationalism, then why will our political class ever bother to tackle these pressing issues. We need a revolution without it India will only get worse there is no doubt about it. Everyone said after BJP won that their biggest upper hand was of their grip over social media so imo we should focus on social media as everyone is there even old generation on fb..

&#x200B;

to change people mind the best option is to show them an alternative because without that people will say if not modi then who, and imo if we look at political parties the best alternative is APP as that party was made after a revolt and most people in delhi are also happy with their work. if we look at lalu, mamta, mayawati etc etc i dont think they are a better alternative

&#x200B;

so to make a change we can target where most people are there like facebook or twitter and make some pages which shows what are fake news and people in that group should target other groups 

to change people minds we have to talk in a certain way that will make them realize what is happening

to target other groups make post about comparison between alternative govt. and current govt. , and what developed countries provide like sweden and what modi does, basically comparison about positive things and modi

and make memes and videos of modi's previous promices and now,

find a nickname for the current government for making fun and critizing them,

share links in their groups critizing the govt. and people from our group should upvote it to make it seen,

&#x200B;

to sum it up we should critize the government in a way which makes people realize what is happening (on major issues which they cant ignore) and should do this in groups (giving each other upvotes so the post does not die) and if you find ideas share everywhere you can...

Does freedom lead to happiness? Are freedom and happiness synonymous to each other or can one exist without the other? What is more important in this world, happiness or freedom? 


P.S. Zada philosophical hgya but I would love to hear your thoughts on this subject in as much detail as possible. I love rants as long as they make sense. It'll be interesting to what are your views on it keeping in mind the current political climate."," >Lately, I have been wondering about freedom a lot courtsey the current political climate. What is freedom? How do you define it? Is it necessary or the idea of it is just overhyped? 

Freedom would be the ability of a person  to act per his/her will, so long as no one else is harmed. Yes, it's necessary. 

>Are restrictions on freedom necessary for development considering the fact that absolute freedom can lead to anarchy?

I believe that in an ideal world, morality can be a guiding rule to absolute freedom. Kant's philosophy is a great example:

Kant, believed that certain types of actions (including murder, theft, and lying) were absolutely prohibited, even in cases where the action would bring about more happiness than the alternative.  For Kantians, there are two questions that we must ask ourselves whenever we decide to act:  

(i) Can I rationally will that everyone act as I propose to act?  If the answer is no, then we must not perform the action.  

(ii)  Does my action respect the goals of human beings rather than merely using them for my own purposes?  Again, if the answer is no, then we must not perform the action.  (Kant believed that these questions were equivalent).

If you've seen the movie kingdom of heaven, watch this video: [Kingdom of Conscience, or Nothing](https://youtu.be/RRoJey3NBvE)

>Does freedom lead to happiness? Are freedom and happiness synonymous to each other or can one exist without the other? What is more important in this world, happiness or freedom? 

I'm not gonna elaborate on happiness part of your question. Too much for one post :p But I'll say that I don't think we should equate the two. Yes, one can exist without the other. In the world, freedom would be more important. In an ideal world, it would be easier to remedy lack of happiness than lack of freedom. > Are freedom and happiness synonymous to each other or can one exist without the other? 

I think being happy is easier when you don't have absolute freedom. Because with freedom comes responsibilities and being happy when you have a lot of responsiblities is difficult. Before addressing your questions I would like to flesh out these abstract concepts a little bit more. Isaiah Berlin's lecture, "" Two concepts of liberty"", might be a good place to start. Have a read if you can but tl;dr he draws the distinction between positive and negative liberty. Very simplistically by positive liberty he means freedom to( actualize or determine the possibilities of my existence) and by negative freedom he means freedom from(usually intervention from the state or other paternalistic institutions). I think we can all agree that certain forms of negative freedoms are desirable (freedom to buy stuff with our money for instance). But for me the positive concept of liberty is far more interesting and what we should really aspire to. This is also the sense in which Hegel uses the word freedom(-ish). For Hegel freedom isn't just freely choosing to do what I will but being comfortable or relaxed in presence of the 'other'. So to answer your questions yes to freedom. But remember freedom is not just having 100s of restaurants to choose from when you order food but its the ability to go for a walk at 4am if you feel like it or engage in your authentic desires . And this sense of freedom does not conflict with duty in fact it presupposes it. Its important to note however that for Hegel freedom is also not something that can be willed into existence by the subject. >Absolute freedom can lead to anarchy

Why do you sound like you're feared of that?

>Are restrictions on freedom necessary for development

Since you're going to back to fundamentals, you might as well as ask what is ""Development""? The RW views in political climate rn looks very much like described in philosophy of **Slavoj Zizek****^(\[1\])**. The liberal views have some semblance with the work of Baudrillard (Matrix movies are inspired by some of his work) but I don't think there's any political philosophy that defines liberals well enuf.

Zizek invents the concept of *sublime objects*. Sublime objects are things that may exist only as referent but not referring to actual object. Thus, *The nation*, *AcheDin, Mandirwahinbanega*, $5 tn etc. are all examples of sublime objects. Leaders use them to propagate their ideology as follows. We as political subjects are told that the leadership will tare care of us. And they'll do this in the name of a certain idea. There is an unsaid promise that separates us from the decisions of leaders. To project leadership as the savior doing the needful for the sake of all. He has sophisticated views about how political subjects end up accepting this kinda deal. It is based on the works of a French psychoanalyst, Lacan.

To put it simply, it is our own psychology that tricks us. You know how sometimes during the course of a relnship, we tend to *mirror* the actions and habits of SO and also define a *Real* to denote the couple, something like *Virushka*. This is because the relationship is a fantasy and living in it, adorning it makes us happy.

Well turns out, we do this with leaders as well. In politics, the Real can be democracy, constitution and so on. The mirror stage is civilians participating in newsroom debates, as if they're lawmakers themselves. This makes the leaders legit even when they're responsible for riots, corruption, DeMo chutiyapa and so on. It's exactly like overlooking your toxic gf's quirks even when your friends are constantly warning you. Your mind makes you think you're still under control and you're knowingly approving the actions, even the harmful ones. Weird, right! But explains the rise of Hindutva quite well.

The solution to such a political state of affairs, he calls as *traversing the fantasy.* It's nothing that cannot be applied in current politics, but so far no one seems to be talking on these lines.

I have not much idea about sources of liberal politics, so can't say much about it.

I'm not sure why people can't appreciate what Annadurai meant to his people. This guy was was such a pivotal figure in TN social system. He was a giant amongst men. Completely rational. I don't know the exact saying but he would neither break the coconut in front of Ganapathi, nor the idol of Ganapathi itself. He just wanted pure separation of concerns.

Politics,Rahul Gandhi offers to resign as Congress chief after humiliating Lok Sabha loss : Sources,bs2kv5,https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/elections/lok-sabha-2019/story/-rahul-gandhi-offers-to-resign-as-congress-chief-after-humiliating-lok-sabha-loss-1532930-2019-05-23,," When he offered his resignation there was a loud emotional group that chanted ""Please don't resign, we need you there."" 

On further inspection this was found to be a group of BJP supporters. So Rahul Gandhi gave his resignation to Rahul Gandhi which will be rejected by Rahul Gandhi because Rahul Gandhi says resignation is not a solution of problems created by Rahul Gandhi. Sonia Gandhi rejects his decision. Enough with this nautanki. [UPDATE : Sonia Gandhi rejects resignation offer.](https://www.news18.com/amp/news/politics/rahul-gandhi-offers-to-resign-as-congress-president-after-another-rout-sonia-gandhi-says-no-2157043.html) If I were Raga, I would not offer, I will resign with immediate effect. Go back to Amethi and stay there till UP elections. Build cadre there and ensure Congress's win in at least 10 assembly constituencies around Amethi and build some self respect. 

Stop spreading these news through source to gain sympathy for your bootlickers to say ""no no please don't"" 
Honestly, he should resign. 

INC is in need of a new face, a leader who can stand up to the likes of Modi and Shah which is an extremely challenging task in itself, RaGa just isn’t capable of doing that. 

I don’t like Modi, but I don’t hate him either. He projected himself not only as a politician, but as a genuine leader... 

I feel quite sad for RaGa today, but the reality is, he just doesn’t have what it takes to be a politician..

*Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be. The measure of a person, is how well they succeed at being who they are.* I think the only way INC’s dynastic hegemony will end is if they suffer successive defeats in the elections reducing their relevance. They did not learn from 2014 mandate and they will not learn from 2019. 

It is ridiculous that a pan india party wins seats less than local parties. 

I think we will see more of the MGB style alliances forming to be a viable opposition front rather than a strong single pan india opposition party which is not optimal because you have ragtag mix of local parties without a uniform agenda that can potentially take on power at center. At this point anyone who wants RaGa to stay as head of congress is actually bjp supporters..

Seriously though modi have some much to thank him. Because of RaGa today NDA have the biggest mandate since 1984!!! 

How can anyone screw this badly is beyond me..any common rickshaw driver might actually be better politician than RaGa CWC won’t accept it . Mummy ko resignation dega kya Forget offering to resign. He should just do it. He has offered in the past too. It's high time the Gandhi family learn their lesson. What's the minimum number of seats to be leader of opposition? Is RaGa at least getting that? /s Can't get over these incompetent fucks who can't pose a fucking challenge to the incumbent government. We deserve a better opposition than these one-family ass licking politicians. He hasn't offered anything. He has immediately started working on helping BJP win in 2024

First party president who helped opposition party win twice!! Here's a conspiracy theory: Rahul Gandhi is a BJP implant to destroy Congress from within. 😆 Fun Fact: If you catch a train from Churchgate(Mumbai) station and travel towards North. The first Congress MP you will find is in Punjab. It was rejected by Sonia gandhi DO IT. PLEASE. I BEG YOU. It’s about time He was the media's darling Prince ready to take the throne of the Prime Minister's office a decade ago. It's funny how the Congress and its media machine projects him as PM material when he's not had to work an honest day's work his whole life and has no street smarts or book smarts whatsoever. Drama What on earth is *offering* to the resign? Just do it, and take your entitled brat sister along with you. Rahul Gandhi to reject Rahul Gandhi's resignation. Offers!! this guy should retire and go abroad before he do anymore damage. High time. He needs to resign. And other leaders of congress should be demanding it by now. Please leave! Let someone competent take the helm. The ground that will be be disappointed by this the most is the BJP I'm not fully up to speed with Indian politics, however isn't it generally normal in democracies for a party leader to resign if he/she suffers a near electoral wipeout? Looking at Indian election results it looks like the Indian National Congress lost 79% of their 206 seats at the 2014 General Election, so how was it possible for Shree Rahul Gandhi to remain leader? You would surely think that the grassroots or the principal donors would effectively force the former leader out, right? Please get the message already!  
The people don't see RaGa as a potential PM, you've lost once, lost twice.  
Change the face of your party and please it not be a family INC will dissolve without a Gandhi. It is a fact. 

And also the current Gandhi will be it's downfall.

Either way INC is dead. After losing the elections, when you have the matters to fight elections which can lead to lose for BJP.

I think that RaGa should step down. This will send a positive message to the voters who have mindset of Nepotism & Congress. He should work in party but he should also give chance to new politicians Thing is, people are automatically attracted to strength, boldness and ferociousness in a leader, no matter what development he does/doesn't do.  
  
To defeat Modi, u need his equal in personality. RaGa may be a decent PM but he is a wet tissue in personality compared to Modi. If Rahul had any chance, Congress would have faired better

Please do your self a favour, retire and go live your life.  If Congress has no other leader to replace Rahul, then it should be doomed Congress is a franchise model political party, the Gandhi’s are the brand name and policy bearers of the company, the state leaders have their own company and supporters and use the franchise.

The Gandhi’s do not allow the franchisees to gain too much power, for example Rajasekar Reddy of AP who was very powerful and called the shots, Siddaramiah too is powerful.

So since the Gandhi’s have the brand and goodwill and it franchises it to a local leader in return for funds, power and cadre Human Resources.

Hence no Gandhi’s will relinquish their leadership position, and no franchisees will accept a no brand leader from top, and voters too will not vote for Congress unless it’s lead by Gandhi’s.

Hence the term greedy as a pig. In a scenario rahul might step down, he needs to make sure someone worthy gets the mantle. Otherwise the congress might just implode like what happened to the aiadmk in tamil nadu.

I really do hope he resigns from the top post. He did the best he can this time but the results hardly changed compared to last time. Radical changes are needed to change the fortunes of the congress party in 2024. It is extremely dangerous to let the BJP have absolute majority especially with modi-shah’s aggresive immoral tactics to stay in power. Same old modus operandi. Sigh. J U M L A Here is the same news from 2014: https://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/sonia-gandhi-rahul-gandhi-offer-to-resign-from-congress-posts-after-defeat-party-refuses/articleshow/35348660.cms Why even offer,You are the leader.,just resign.Ye koi movie hein kya jo Saare congressi rote huey, per pakad ke bolege resign mat karo,Aap hi hamaari hope ho.Most of the senior leaders,who have themselves lost need to be ousted from leadership roles in congress. CWC may reject the offer , but honestly I think he should resign. No matter how much I like this guy sensiblity ,but leader like him dont work in India. India public like leaders who can make them feel like they're someone great and proud ( even if it's just false dream ) .Modi can do that, Rahul can't. INC need the same type of leader. Rahul wasn't bult for politics. He's a nice person I'm sure but he doesn't have the quick wits, or the farsight to be in politics. Should have done it 5 years ago, I'm not a BJP supporter and voting for a regional party is fucking pointless in national election and Congress gave absolutely no reason to vote for them As much as I admire him as a person, he's no match for Amit Shah. He should straight up quit the post instead of all this offering resignation crap. Haha, that snake will say anything, but never resign ### another PR stunt, he will submit they wont accept. Fuck with this all BS. Finally About time. Please do. Palpatine voice: Dewit! Okay whatever it is, what the f is that photo? Gandhi-mukt Congress? Might have a fighting chance next time around... Tomorrow, Rahul gandhi will give his resignation to Rahul gandhi which will be rejected by Rahul gandhi because Rahul gandhi says resignation is not a solution of problems created by Rahul gandhi.

Rahul Gandhi then will request Rahul Gandhi to continue to guide the Congress which Rahul Gandhi will accept and will thank Rahul Gandhi for reposing faith in Rahul Gandhi. Guys how long are we going to allow the media to control our conversations with their ""sources""? lol. WTF is this ‘offer’ to resign?  Just resign and go away, because one has to search really hard to an equally ineffective leader. They wanted to win on an Anti-Modi sentiment but ironically lost to an Anti-Rahul mandate. If congress wants to survive it needs to leave the Gandhis alone and get more capable leaders on the front. And definitely stop this drama of getting sympathy for Rahul. Rahul go back I hope Shashi Tharoor becomes the new leader. Why offer? Just resign. If everyone in the country had 10 paise for every time this guy offered to resign, then there would be no need for the 15 lakhs in bank account. Just do it! -nike ""offers"" like he's doing a favor to the country. 

Let him be there. It could be a major turn in Indian politics where unaware people genuinely understand that family lineage doesn't deserve shit. Usual nautanki. He didn't had any remorse on his face. He and his sister were smiling like nothing happened. Ye Kam election se pahle karna cahiye tha, ab Kya fayda. It would be wrong to say that congress is any nationalists now.

Don't give me history of party ,just facts, you try to get voters and inititae himdu terro at the front to appease them, what morons do you  think indians are.

You contest a guy who was dancing with half naked girls against pragya, who was given clean chit by ec, you had lil knowledge of rafale, and sc gave clean chit to it,so you fund your party lawyers to reopen the case the goto ralies to and say, ""look ,sc opened the case once again, they might have found modi guilty"" 

Last but not least, you were having anti-india imgae when you questioned indian army .

You deserved it. I think it was just a PR move. Rahul Gandhi is critical for India's success. His presence keeps the deeply corrupt Congress away from power. It's high time now.congress needs to project someone who is strong and capable I am resigning,and I appoint didi or mummy as the new chief until we get some success then I will be back as chief again and will get lauded for revival of congress.And then again we will appoint a PM who has to toe the party lines, doesn't matter if he looks weak.

Then we will lose few elections,come back riding the anti incumbency wave and cycle will go on. Gandu going? Oh no! Yayyy!! He should resign without any nautanki and take her mother, sister and brother-in-law with him. Let Congress fall apart, and use it as an opportunity to make this party from ground up again. They have to stop applying bandaids to deep wounds.

Congress is doomed till this family is at helm. Rahul Gandhi has absolutely nothing to show for except big words. A borderline voter would never take chance with him, they would rather vote for a regional party than him.

I think Congress is important for India but not in present state and definitely not with Gandhi family in charge. We need a Congress party that's rooted in socially and economically progressive ideals, and have people that have made their way up top organically. Until then, he will have to keep giving such bogus resignations. I hope Congress doesn't take any hasty decisions. The Gandhi family is what is holding the party together. With that said I think Priyanka is a better fit to lead the party. I lost my 72000k He will offer it to the Congress committee. He is the President, but there is a committee of senior people such as Digvijay Singh, Shashi Tharoor, Ashok Gehlot, etc. who shall be consulted. There is a huge gap for a center right, unabashedly capitalist party that doesn't shy away from being seen as pro-Hindu in India.

For all practical purposes, BJP is silly socialist. Their fiscal agenda is no different from that of Congress. 

If the Congress can dump the Gandhis, move to the right, be secular (that doesn't mean pandering to the minorities and hosting Iftaar parties), they have a strong chance in 2024. I wonder when people in Congress realize that the Gandhi-Vadra complex is a massive liability for them. Offers! The entitled prince has ...OMG.... OFFERED!

Thank you prince .... thank you for your generous offer to resign. Hi, I am not an Indian but I trade Emerging market indices which got me interested in this elections. We view continuation of existing regimes as bullish. Most folks seem to be bullish that Modi will continue economic reforms, although the recent intervention in Central Banker RBI wasn't viewed favorably.

I am curious about the opposition party, which seems to be an arm of a single family since inception? Usually when you lose back to back elections, a rebel more extreme wing develops which tries to take control of the party (like how alt right took control of Republican Party through Trump, an outsider).

Is there any such group within Congress and what are the chances they can take control from existing group and attempt to win next elections (or midterms if such an event exists).

Thanks. Now I can live peacefully for another 5 years. Unless this nincompoop decides to run for the PMs post again. RaGa should dig in and hold his ground. He should choose a more prominent face like Tharoor or Chidambar as a PM candidate next time and retain his position as the party chief. Just like how Sonia did in UPA1/2. If a 4th standard pass guy can run this country.. really anyone can. Besides BJP knows how to win elections but to deliver concrete economic building measures is an all together different ball game. How long will they fudge data? This is the perfect time to start a change.org to have a likable figure like captain Amrinder or Tharoor as president of the party. Someone please do that. When I saw his speech conceding defeat, despite myself I felt bad for him. I think he knows he's not cut out for politics and wants out, and his offer to resign is genuine, but his family and party won't let him.

For what it's worth I think underneath all this he's someone who genuinely wants to do good even though his politics, policies and party are all wrong.

I wouldn't vote for him now, but given his (relative) youth he's likely to become PM some day, be it 2024 or 2029. And I think I'd be fine with that. I feel congress bartered its seats to save robert vadra and also 2 defamation cases filed on them by anil ambani and adani

How come just a day before anil ambani took the case back and today adani ? 😏 He sounds like the Hillary Clinton of India To be honest, I for whatever reason want to see Rahul Gandhi at higher power (or maybe a PM one day) but for that to happen, he needs to get his shit together. He needs to actually work for this stuff (the same kind of activeness that was observed the past few months) consistently for the next 5 years. [deleted] Rahul has plenty of time left to strengthen his base become PM in his life unlike Modi who used all his resources to get the PM-ship lol. Chill guys.

Looks like the next elections will deliver a Congress mukt bharat. Wasn't the social media manager of Congress going to do 1 more ama after the results? Things opposition has to improve :

1. They need to get rid of nepotism, at least at the top. Most of parties in MGB are dynastic and have history of corruption. Do away with old guard and bring in some fresh blood and ideas. To do that these parties will have to adopt an internal constitution and processes to ensure rise of meritorious candidates. Currently, it seems impossible. 

 

2. Embrace true secularism i.e. stop pandering to a community for votebank. Support secular Uniform civil code and be adamant at separation of governance and religion.  

 

3. Do good work at the states where they are in power. Stop fighting elections on the failures of Modi, fight elections on your merits. 
 


4. Opposition also needs to identify the rotten apples and distance itself from them. Mamata has shown dictatorial tendencies and her party is famed for its use of violence. No need to establish ties with her. She will bring you down with her. Enemy of enemy is my friend doesn't apply in politics. Aligning with someone who has contrasting vision and aspirations sends mixed signals to the voter. 


5. Have a vision paper based on development, progress, true secularism, equality , national security and climate. Fighting elections purely on caste equations and quota promises will only get this far. Room for Caste politics is diminishing and in next 20 years, may start to become irrelevant. 


I can see opposition embracing 3 and 4, but not 1 and 2, therefore the opposition loses might keep on piling.


Edit : Added point 5


Edit 2: I voted for BJP because to me the alternative was a coalition of dynastic regional parties with history of corruption such as RJD, SP, BSP, DMK, CBN's party, TMC and that would have been catastrophic for our nation. 

If political parties implement the amendments that I have stated, then we have an excellent opportunity to elevate the political discourse and improve the governance. I don't favour any party. But this is bad for India, not because BJP got elected. But because there is a non-existent opposition party. Too much power at one party didn't always bode well for India.


One good thing about this election: dynasty politics getting obliterated.  \-Narendra Modi finishes thanking supporters and world leaders.

Copypasta from Insta, found it funny so..... Rahul's resignation rejected.

Well, fuck. I believe Congress, SP, BSP etc all need fresh faces at the top. Rahul and Akhilesh bhaiyya are memes. Notice how the final results are yet to be formally declared - as of 12pm , 24th May. This is because of verifying of VVPAT slips from 5 random EVMs from each constituency. No reports of any discrepancy yet. I hope this ends the EVM discussion. Why BJP Won:   
(Numbers from BJP President's press conference)

\- 3 Years of preparation (From January 2016)  
\- 3000 full time on ground workers focusing on Lok Sabha & Vidhan Sabha constituencies for the last two years  
\- 18 National level committees headed by senior ministers  
\- 29 State level committees involving 435 senior leaders.  
\- 482 Constituency level committees having 7,230 karyakartas in positions of responsibility  
\- 11 crore registered karyakartas (expanded from 2.5 crores in 2014)  
\- 161 Call Centers providing backup support for the last 6 months to karyakartas engaged in a campaign to reach 24 crores 81 lakh people

Ideology is important.   
Social media reach is important.   
Arguments and rants are important.   
But nothing can substitute the impact of pure hard work done meticulously. I have a question. Why do people of Punjab vote for Congress and not BJP unlike other North Indian states? One thing is clear from the comments in this post: quite a few people misinterpret democracy as ""whatever I think good"" and intelligence as ""agreeing with me"". Daenerys Targaryens are abundant. I dont wana jump anybody. Just curious.

Rajasthan has ruling party Congress, still how did they not win even one seat?? This is the best result that could have happened. UPA sucks real bad, plus they don't bring anything to the table. Voting for UPA  just means voting for one family with only a vision to get re elected, nothing for the nation. The congress should ditch the Gandhis if it wants to have any future. My generation has no place in our hearts for them quite simply.  

As for a strong opposition,  AAP made that space, credible with decent faces and leaders. If Kejriwal had not made stopping the BJP his only agenda and concentrated on expanding only his party, probably made a 20 year roadmap, We could have a good left face to BJPs right. A two party system which would have the complete range of ideological offerings. Non-Indian leftist here, I heard from a friend that a big part of Modi's win was his successful electrification/running water projects in poorer areas, which made up for the weaker macroeconomic factors. How much truth is there to this? I am kind of surprised that why some people (read opposition) was not able to gauge the scale of the expected win.I mean Modi may not be an autocrat but he seems to get some shit done. Ujjwala Yojna ,Mudra Yojna and PM-KISAN were delivered to people in much more efficient way than the past precedence. In India, people want to give second chance to the one who seems to do things. [removed] [**Not more than 250 for NDA, was my secret wish: Jagan**](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/not-more-than-250-for-nda-was-my-secret-wish-jagan-736218.html)

Lol. I like that he's so open about it. I suspect there were several other regional leaders that were hoping for a similar outcome for an entry into the NDA. KCR, Naveen Patnaik, maybe even MK Stalin and Mayawati.  PM-Kisan for farmers and Ujjwala scheme  were two main schemes which created a strong under current for BJP even in those states which the party recently lost and also Ayushman bharat is also popular among lower income group people ,Modi not only able to kick off these schemes but also able to take them to people directly  like in our house maid was happy and in village women were happy by getting gas cylinders instead of daily cow-dung cakes process.Same goes with PM-Kisan farmers received their 1st installment directly in their accounts before elections. This is what happens when you have no credible opposition and a bunch of corrupt to the core and greedy regional parties. Hoping for Piyush Goyal as Finance Minister Congress gained at the expense of non-aligned forces. So, the *mahagathbandhan* was a massive failure. NDA has one seat less as compared to 2014. BJP won 303 seats this time. What was their tally in 2014? Was it 336 or 352 in 2014 ? I think Ayushman Bharat pushed a lot of votes in Tier-II and Tier-III cities towards BJP. Any opinions ? Only person who could have taken on Modi was probably Amarinder Singh. 

You want to use nationalism? Well, Amarinder served in the armed forces. 

You want use the Sikh killings? Amarinder is a sikh. 

You want to use Modi's experience? Well, Amarinder is a CM of a border state. 

But ofcourse, the Gandhis would rather keep power to themselves than do something good for the party. According to India Today - Axis:

&#x200B;

The most important issue for people when deciding who to vote for was 

&#x200B;

Unemployment (33%)

&#x200B;

National Security was at 9%. 

&#x200B;

I think this is should be a clear message to to INC that people just don't see Rahul Gandhi as a capable leader who can solve India's problems. [removed] BTW it looks like the NDA will finally get a majority in the Rajya Sabha by 2020.

Aside from overblown fears about Emergency and changing the Constitution, it'll enable them to pass long-stalled bills like the Land Acquisition Reforms and Triple Talaq Bill. If you consider politicians as entrepreneurs like I do , we can see that BJP is a party (organisation) of first generation entrepreneurs who got their big break (funding) during the Emergency or the Ram Mandir movement. 

While the opposition seems like a tepid slow organisation of third , fourth or in case of the congress, fifth generation entrepreneurs. This manifests in the energy levels we see in the two organisations. While one is all about hustling and getting things done (some of which may be wrong), the second is plagued with unnecessary overhead costs that have no marginal utility whatsoever. 

Either the promoters step back and let a professional handle the organisation or this will not end up well for them. Lastly , this is a new India. We do not dream about government jobs. We dream about startups. We dream about doing things (which may be wrong ). We sure as hell hate the status quo. So regional parties lost the most?

I've always felt we need more diversity in the Parliament, but it seems that thats not what the most of the country feels.

I think the politics of appealing to the weakest and the backward is over. Maybe we've really moved on from being a primarily poor country and moving towards being a middle income country. In which case politicians will need to change their tactics.


In this regard, Modi is the only one speaking to people's aspirations. Everyone else is still stuck at hand outs and government programs. I guess that isnt enough anymore. And its as if RG and all the other party heads have missed the memo.


TLDR: BijliSadakPani is not enough anymore Sambit Patra lost or Won. Can't trust the media these days. Riding the ""Me first"" wagon they have stopped verifying sources.

Imagine instead of working on policies Sambit Patra shouting in Parliament ""Mandir Yahi Banega"" [removed] Modi won election massively not just because of his work and performance but also because of the failure of Congress and especially Rahul Gandhi .hopefully they stop blaming the EVM and find out the real reason behind their biggest defeat and serve the country. This might be the time for BJP to start delivering their worth. The nation has shown trust, and its not something complicated that is needed, although it is hard. 

This election also shows a massive gap in the absence of a reasonable 3rd front. I hope the next election gives us some semblance of it at a national level, that people who connect can hopefully get behind. For eg, TN has no clue what they're doing. It all points to the fact that we don't have a good 3rd alternative. 

Democracy wins only when there is a ruling party and a non-senile opposition party working towards development with a north-star focus. Approach might be different, but things will be thought through. 

I'm not discounting what BJP is capable of doing, but their momentum is very high now. An influential opposition will ensure they don't derail. We can't say the same now. Rahul must resign Any ideas on how many for NOTA? AAP who? ...I’d say with finality that this is the end of “Muslim appeasement” in India.

If those of you that maybe have a better clue than myself could please chime in on what this means for Islamic populations in India and whether there would be a more dramatic mass emigration of these populations to more Islam-friendly countries? [deleted] What I disliked the most was the opposition leaders claiming voter fraud when exit polls showed things look grim for them. Just be gracious and don't let the efforts of EC, the security forces and thousands of people who worked to keep this election free and fair be clouded like this. Our EC gives training and seminars around the world to newer democracies on how to conduct elections. They must be doing something right The bad thing in all this is the opposition does not know how to oppose. Congress, Tmc,Sp-Bsp are people who have been in power for quite a while.(That is also a problem with modi). But the difference here is we see is the process in which was able to acquire such leadership is through hardwork. Do not get me wrong,the guy is shrewd and conniving and will do anything to crush. The unique factor is that he knows it is not his job to crush. It is ours. We have the ability to take power out. He knows that and now it is proven that having money and connections dont matter. Other parties lost because of one thing,they continuously forgot about our power. BJP has fault in many way and right now in my opinion the majority voted for BJP is because of modi and his potential. The way the centre has been working now is astounding. Due to the 2014 election I wished to become an ias officer. 
And one more thing you should understand. People are not stupid anymore. Lok sabha is a different beast and assembly is a different beast. I live in Maharashtra and I a way I can imagine Maharashtrans not voting for BJP. What people are scared about now is the uncertainty. BJP knew they will win but not by this margin. This chat reminded me why I came on reddit. To stay away from Indian keyboard warriors. Thanks for reminding me :) Fucking delhi people. Atishi worked so hard for them and they voted for some cricketer(50%+). I dont care if this wasn't state election. 

I hope AAP loses in next election and they shut down AAP. These people don't deserve true politicians. Its not worth fighting for such people at all. Let them have actors and cricketers. How is NDA -1 I thought they did better than before? The land of self-respect movement, Tamil Nadu, sends two Ambedkarites, four communists (one of whom is a Sahitya Academy award winning writer), and three women writers to the parliament. Left politics should have been almost decimated with just one member in the parliament, but Stalin saves Marx in TN and sends four communists to the parliament. Can anyone give an insight into why TDP lost in Andhra Pradesh? [This](https://imgur.com/a/TugSAjS) is the Official Assembly wise result tabulation for Moradabad Lok Sabha Constituency. NRC had a significant role in propelling NDA in Assam. Opinions ? Would've been good for the nation if Congress didn't lose by such a large margin. I was expecting a 40% majority votes for Congress and 60% for BJP. This crushing defeat is bad. A party shouldn't have this much power. It'll only raise their arrogance to the peaks. That little fear of 'people might not vote for me next time if I don't try to do be a good leader' is what kept them in check. I think congress is dead. Like this year they hunt people to stand for Election and next election there will br free seat to contest under their party banner. Really what break trust at exterme level rather than courrption for an    Indian people Just want to ask a question. Modi took advantage of polarization. That's definitely one of the major reasons behind his landslide victory ( apart from presence of an worthy opponent etc). But polarization means presence of at least two poles. Who created these poles? Modi? Or were these poles always present in the common mind and Modi just added fuel to it? If it was present before, who actually created this pole? And accepted Hindutva is one of these poles, but from where the other pole is coming? As far as I know, Modi is promoting (or taking advantage of) the Hindutva pole, but from where this other pole is getting formed (or has already formed)? I can't speak for everyone in TN but the folks i know in my area of TN (Trichy) voted against BJP because of increase in communal tensions and demonetization, all the BJP supporters i know in TN are upper class brahmins This election is a watershed moment in Indian history. Welcome to the New India™. Just to put this into perspective, this win makes Modi a democratically elected leader voted in by almost a half a billion people; a genuine and credible mandate. Let that sink in for the moment. Just from the backing perspective, he is bigger than Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Akbar, Prithviraj Chauhan or any other historical figure in Indian history. India has not seen such a leader.

For good or bad, India is going to change dramatically over the next few decades. It will be a far cry from the India that we grew up in, part Socialist part Capitalistic, looking for an identity, a place in the world. Our children will grow up in a completely different India which is for all intents and purposes already a Hindu Rashtra. No constitution change is needed. As Modi pointed it out in his speech yesterday, secularism is now a dirty word and no politician can use (or abuse) it anymore.  

Bit by bit, Modi will consolidate power, just as Xi, Putin, Ergodan and all other authoritarians before him. With no credible opposition, he will do everything to keep himself in power, including destroying the very institution which brought him into power, the RSS. Although I do believe Modi has the right interests at heart and wants the best for India, he's a politician and self-preservation is going to trump national interest in the end. A credible opposition will eventually emerge and will most probably be from within the Sangh Pariwar itself. 

I personally am looking forward to this New India. I think it's going to be exciting. I expect a lot of changes, both good and bad in equal measure which I'm fine with. Just for keepsakes, I have saved today's newspaper. Whichever side of history Modi ends up in, we will look back to this day and recount it to our children and grandchildren.  [removed] Hope opposition asks good questions in parliament. Unchecked power is dangerous! Now that I have had some time to ponder on the result, I think that this government will not drastically change our country even with the majority seats. This will be more or less similar to other 2nd term governments. 

India will not really transform as much as we think it should under Modi's reign. The development will continue in the same rate, the system will be cleansed but in a glacial pace, the saffronisation will also be done relatively slowly. 

India will become a strong country with global importance in the future but it will never become a superpower. Indian people will have more money to spend but we will not be a rich country. 

Modi was right in his speech in a way, there will be no poor people in the country because they will be extinguished. Only a large middle class and a substantial upper class will remain. Because this was a mandate by the money, for the money, of the money.

All in all, India will become a bit more right-leaning country than before but it will still remain India. I will still be spat upon, riding my cycle, from a passing by vehicle. Some of us will be a uncomfortable at first but we will learn to adjust over the years. After all, we are Indians. Personally, I don't think it was a good idea to give so much power to a person like Modi.

But I guess, a significant percent of my countrymen disagree with me..... and I respect their decision.

Lets hope power does not ""corrupt"" him. Wonder why Nota never won smh [deleted] Can someone find out the data on how many women and non-Hindu candidates were elected as MPs? Or is there a list, official or unofficial, of the winning candidates? Kerala and TN mi amigos! Quick question from an Indian American. How did IUML win the Ramanathapuram election in Tamil Nadu? The district is 70%+ Hindu, so I was surprised to see a pro-Muslim interests party win? Was there just really low turnout for Hindu's, or was there another reason? [deleted] As a South Indian I am concerned about both the polar ends of the political spectrum.

The separatist dravidian movement is reflexively projecting the BJP as a Northern invader. 

The BJP's ham-handed approach has really alienated large sections of these states that are extremely concerned about their linguistic and regional identity. 

Both sides need to moderate their stands. [deleted] [removed] The NDA got 352 in the last election I am waiting for the Pulwama conspiracy theories This sub is swarming with the pro-modi supporters since the election. So many posts are downvoted to oblivion if it is anti-bjp or talking about anything related to the muslims.  Probably my own post is gonna be heavily downvoted because it is related.

&#x200B;

The recent elections are going to make the minorities feel nervous about their future. They might not get killed by the gau rakshaks on the open but they can face more open or subtle discrimination on areas like housing,jobs,education and even government services since the racist supporters are getting a validation this time. It already happened in modi's gujrat, the same can happen in the entire north. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minorities-made-to-live-in-fear-we-must-end-this-pm-to-party/articleshow/69500818.cms Am a Tamil guy who spent first 18 years of his life in Delhi and now 8 years and counting in Chennai. Was never really a guy who would take a side when everyone around me would fight about north India vs South India. Always thought all are equal Indians and this is just a silly childish fight. 
And Delhi being the home where I spent my teenage and adolescence, one day I do wanted to come back and live there. But after seeing the overwhelming majority of such an organisation (don't wanna go into what is wrong with them, save it) yesterday, I am done with the people of North. 2014 was understandable, people wanted change. But after all that happened in 5 years, why would such a majority want them back. I wouldn't be able to live with that mentality. Perhaps TN is the right place.

<Just needed a place to rant. I don't have any political inclinations to any other party as well. All are useless. But the ruling one is worse in more than one humanitarian grounds> can anyone tell when will elections happen on Vellore seat You can't fight a cult of personality with ideas and rhetoric. 

Godi media TV channels successfully brainwashed the electorate that Modi is Mhysa, a savior who ""sacrificed"" everything for ""Bharat Mata"", a ""strong"" leader, a person who works ""18 hours a day"" serving the nation. The ""300 killed in balakot"" bullshit was flashed non stop and was swallowed by the people. Ask anyone and they won't say they voted for BJP, they would say they voted for Modi. They might not even know who their local candidate was.

All the justifications we give like - maybe Jan dhan worked, maybe Ayushman worked - are hollow. Nobody cared about these schemes. BJP had the weakest, emptiest manifesto and no messaging on real issues. People voted for the superhero named Modi. A fictional character carefully crafted with a backstory, unrealistic achievements in his childhood and youth and reinforced with ""a day in the life of"" narratives with questions like mango eating and wallet keeping.

Modi occupies the same space in the psyche of the electorate which a godman or a ""chamatkari baba"" does. 

The southern states patting their backs for not voting for this charlatan shouldn't forget how they too have similarly worshipped leaders like MGR & Jayalalithaa in the past. Modi image building was from the same playbook in fact, creating a larger than life persona. Education has nothing to do with this. This is solely a lack of critical thinking and failure to question the narrative set by the mainstream media which comes from the ""accept what you're told"" mindset Indians are brought up with. The World Leader.......@ModiJi Yogendra Yadav fears that Bengal would become a battlefield for 2021 elections given the results in Lok Sabha.

It looks quite funny when Modi talked of inclusivity yesterday when his entire campaign lacked all those things. His twists and turns are lapped up quite easily and everything he said is forgotten conveniently.

The perpetual campaign machine while has reaped benefits for the party will probably leave our nation in a bad shape. BJP reminds me of the left in bengal. I can see it ruling on hate and this right wing vibe till economic numbers catch up and they fail altogether. If they really had some solution, they would have done something useful and not shitty demonetisation. But all that is fluff. We will see raw wisdom again. We will bitch again. They will use ram mandir and pakistan again in 2023. We will forget kathua and vote back again in 2024. This will continue, till the day, it actually won't. And that day, will be very bad. The sangh, just like CPIM will become a non existent entity, an entity whose ideas would be trashed. Unemployment has reached record numbers at a time when demographic dividend has peaked. It's a sorry state. The right wingers are fapping hire and fire as a solution. But that isn't even close to a solution. Electoral bonds, fudging gdp numbers, the list goes on and on

Every idea has its time. We had record low petrol prices. The BJP govt was a failure. And it will be a failure again. But it will win again. Mark my words. 

Amit shah is the mourinho of that bjp team. He can bring those results by tactics. But even moruinho couldn't save chelsea and manu what the fuck happened to AAP? I mean seriously voting gambhir over atishi, what kind of sickness is prevailing in Delhi? All this time I had heard that AAP had done great work in Delhi, reduced pricing for water, electricity, single window clearances, great school and everything but at the end of the day people still voted for BJP in Delhi instead of AAP.    
 I just can't get my around this fact, I mean motherf***ing delhi, what the hell were you thinking. For a second, I say that Modi is great and has insane schemes launched, but what happened to decentralisation of politics and the very basic idea of democracy. Man, honestly whoever shit people may have voted in other parts of India thinking at least Modi is better, I seriously would like to say to anyone from Delhi, boyyo you had an option to vote for a good candidate and yet you didn't. Man i really can't describe the shitload I want to drop on anyone from Delhi who voted for BJP. Worse is the fact that AAP was 3rd in most of the seats not even a runner up candidate.

1) stuff every open or partially available position with supporters. Heads of movie boards, education, military.

2) eradicate and arrest congress leaders where possible.

It’s the best time to switch to the turkey model.

Edit: saying this without elaborating is unfair.

The BJP is regularly going to face the fact that it’s chief economic and governance people are not world class. This means aside from increasing G - government spending, reading R - interest rates, and making laws leaner, they have little options.

This forces them to pull from opinionated and vocal members of society, who are not bureaucrats or economists. They will instead pull from the crop of vocal MBA types with the nest saleable credentials to make lateral entries into the system.

This also means that their government has a natural challenge when it involves unusual economic events. 

This is a political risk when it comes to keeping the voters who voted for Modi’s clean and reformer image, and a risk when it comes to incumbency on the ground which can’t be overcome by identity based incentives.


The BJP knows this, and has to make plans accordingly.

This means a plan beyond modi- which they don’t have yet. 

This also means a plan of best make use of their advantage.

Since they think long term, and learn from the world - this means putting people in positions of patronage and influence who will still remain should there be a turn around in their fortunes. 

Earlier, they didn’t have to worry about this - however this election showed that it is not a congress mukt bharat, and that the anti BJP views are likely to grow stronger.

Either they remove the anti BJP views, which I doubt they care about, or they deal with it. 

This is how they will deal with it, and keep their long term prospects healthy. So, not a single muslim MP from BJP? How many were given tickets? Why was Socrates apprehensive of democracy (5 min):

Politics,Something about Rahul Gandhi hit me hard.,bokvwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bokvwa/something_about_rahul_gandhi_hit_me_hard/,"At 14 years old he saw his beloved grandma get shredded with bullets by the man he used to play with. 
At 21 his father was blown up by terrorists. He didnt even get to see his father's body one last time. 

Deaths are never good. People always get hurt for life and some take a lifetime to recover from the loss of a loved one. But grotesque deaths of not one but TWO close loved ones? I am surprised Rahul didnt go insane from the shock or become a drug/alcohol addict. 

He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves. And never used pity politics to gain votes. 

So when people call him Pappu or make fun of his dad's death, it fills me up with rage because when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life. Something most of us will never or never did suffer in life. 

I dont support Congress, but lets not insult or let neech aadmi's insult and hurt those soft spots."," Most of us would have hung our heads in same after being called Papu 24*7 but that guy has the balls to come out and face the crowd. I also lost my dad when I was 21 😢 Yes. This.

I hate congress and BJP both.

But I never got the unwarranted hate towards RG. (and more so, towards Kejriwal.)

I get that Indian politics isn't a clean haven, but ridiculing someone's identity and making a joke out of everything related to that person, is taking to another level.

I applaud RG for not giving up and still facing the crowd and the camera, with such calmness.

And frankly, his recent interview with Ravish, made me realize he's wayyy better than Modi. At least, he's open to criticism and questions. honestly, whoever wins this election, Rahul Gandhi has become a commendable person in my eyes. dude got balls the size of domes to be shamed publicly to such an extent daily in an out, and still act as a statesman of high order. He can use deaths of his family and honestly get a lot of sympathy votes, but he knows that would be biggest disrespect to their lives, he may not be a great politician, but he is a great person imo. His steep learning curve and resilience are actually inspiring. The interview with Ravish Kumar he says "" Rahul Gandhi has to be eliminated, and I must channel the public's mandate "". That is a very deep and Zen/Upanishadic thought. All the humiliation against himself and his mother (calling her waitress euphemism for prostitute)  he took it in stride and really grew. His message is about inclusion and love. He readily admits his mistakes and is willing to learn. And his assertive nature is very evident in his interviews. If youth in this country are looking for a life lesson this is the guy. 

On the other hand we have the hate spewing Modi whose life message is when you mess up dont own up and instead keep distracting by criticising others. I want to ask bhakts if their children would keep blaming their failures on others would they not teach them to take responsibility? This character deficiency becomes a virtue on Modi. Strange times we live in. Not a Congress or BJP supporter (NACOBS - everyone use this acronym to save time 😋), but Modi would've gained so much sympathy by crying in his speeches if something similar had happened to him. I dont admire Rahul but I absolutely hate Narendra Modi.

He is a grade 1 dumbfuck They call him that because 90% of Indians love making fun of others in a very mean way. Primitive Homo Erectus culture is well and alive in India. They even make fun of IIT grad Kejri because he wears mufflers, coughs and doesn't wear suits or what not. I too lost my grandma when I was 15. She used to talk to me everyday. Still, after 3 years I still feel like she's been talking to me every evening over the phone. There might be about 99 things wrong with Rahul Gandhi but his Never Give Up attitude is worth noting. Tbh I found Priyanka Gandhi's speeches much more compelling. Same for Kejriwal. Character assasination is an old but effective trick. To people saying Modi would've used the shit out of this if it happened to him, It is also worth noting that Modi has never appealed to people due to his OBC status. I think he uses the chaiwala status because it creates a better story, that's it. > He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves. 

You lost me with this line. 

&#x200B;

Sad for him and Priyanka Vadra to go through the ~~deaths~~ assassinations of their grand mother and father at such young ages and yet come out as decent individuals, Politics aside, we're all humans in the end. In this election, RaGa is clearly the lesser of two evils. But let's not get carried away. He is a greatly privileged individual who got far more chances in life than any less privileged person would get after so many fallures. 

The Pappu moniker is a creation of the BJP media cell, and I'll be the first to admit that it is somewhat exaggerated. But let's not forget that RaGa helped them a lot because a lot of his quotes are ridiculous. Now if you're thinking that Modi is just as much of a gaffe machine, I agree. The Congress simply has been unable to sell this idea as effectively as the BJP has sold ""pappu"" though.

Sure, the man currently sitting in the PM chair is a national disgrace. But not jump on the RaGa sympathy train just because of that. I agree with you but if politics is giving a shoulder for somebody who have suffered a lot then it should be given. No one denies that he suffered a lot and is not a ""pappu"" etc. But instead vote him for his vision, etc.
Voting him this way we will do the same thing as when India did by giving Modi votes because he was a chaiwala once. Rahul Gandhi is nice humble dude but wants to maintain status quo. Never though of it in that way, thank you for bringing this up Lets cut the bullshit. He was and continues to be part of the corrupt status quo political class, that includes the ruling party. Like every other politician, he will say anything to get your vote. Fuck Congress . And Fuck BJP. 

The Gandhis are all about power. They use the surname to invoke positive feelings that people have of Mahatma Gandhi and talk down to us during every election . Not to mention, RG and Congress play identity politics to stay relevant all the time . He has no other choice.

He is Rajiv Gandhi's son so naturally he had to be forced by Sonia Gandhi and other Gandhi family loyalists to step up to the plate and take command as the leader of the party otherwise it will someone overambitious who will hijack the party and marginalize the remaining Gandhis from the party. I sympathize with RaGa. It is difficult to cope with a loved ones loss, let alone to a brutal murder. 

But this isn't something unique to him. There have been riots and terrorist attacks across various cities in India and the people there had to literally go back to the same places where other people or may be a relative lost life (spirit of Mumbai, lol). At least RG had alternative to go to UK and get away from this. But most of the country did not.

While it's pretty shameful what BJP is doing with ex-PMs long dead, I don't see a problem with people calling him pappu. That's criticism of his thoughts and actions and he is responsible for it. In 2014, RG made Modi look much better and this time it's the opposite. >At 14 years old he saw his beloved grandma get shredded with bullets by the man he used to play with. At 21 his father was blown up by terrorists. He didnt even get to see his father's body one last time. 

Neither of them were saints or innocent victims. Rahul's dad got blown up by the same terrorist group(LTTE) he and his mother(Indira) started funding and arming in Sri Lanka, starting a bloody civil war that went on for decades with over 1.5 lakh casualties.

Rahul's grandma was killed by her bodyguards as a result of the Sikh insurgency she herself fomented by propping up Bhindranwale and his separatists in Punjab as an alternative to the Akali Dal. It took another decade before the situation in Punjab was normalized. Not before tens of thousands of lives were ruined.

Not to say it wasn't harsh on Rahul... But the phrase 'hoist by your own petard' comes to mind.

>He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves.

Rahul didn't try to become a leader anyone deserved. Until his coronation last year he had spent over 15 years in politics refusing to take up any position of responsibility. He refused to be a CM or a member of MMS's cabinet. He refused to be PM candidate in 2009 and even in 2014 wasn't officially named as such. 

He's only taking up these roles now because Sonia is too old and has retired leaving his party with no other choices.

> And never used pity politics to gain votes. 

Did you even follow his 2014 campaign? He started it by giving speeches where he'd remember being angry when his grandma was killed(Which made everyone cringe because that immediately led to the 1984 riots which he refused to address). He'd complain about trivial things like how his mother scolded him or how Indira made him eat all the vegetables on his plate. He was the epitome of privilege.

And this time he hasn't hesitated to exploit even issues of national security for his gain. He and his party have repeatedly tried to attack the Supreme Court and CJI, going against the advice of senior lawyers in their own party. They've tried to cast doubt on the armed forces over the surgical strikes, airstrike and even Pulwama attack. He personally hounded and harassed Manohar Parrikar while the latter was dying of cancer. I am quite sure OP is aware of all this.


>So when people call him Pappu or make fun of his dad's death, it fills me up with rage because when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life. Something most of us will never or never did suffer in life. 

This is such a vacuous argument. This is the general election, not Big Boss. Nobody is voting for candidates for their sob stories, what people care about is what they are as politicians. Lots of netas no matter how vile their politics is are look like pleasant, charming, even charismatic figures when you meet them in person. I've also read interviews of some journalists who've closely followed Modi(I think Aakar Patel) who say he has a charming and witty personality and they get along with him personally but hate his politics. But nobody highlights or cares about that. Also, most of his ""stupid"" image comes from him not being able to speak Hindi that well I think and also because he used to be a nervous public speaker. He belongs to the most corrupt family in Indian History. Since Independence, we have seen generation after generation this family has orchestrated a mockery of Indian democracy. Somebody has become India's first prime minister despite not being the most popular one. Then came his daughter. Then came her son. Then came his wife. Then came her son. This son turned out to be not so effective, so came his sister. Where does it end? People now seem to be waiting for Priyanka's son to grow up so that he can ascent to the throne. We should be ashamed of ourselves for this servile mentality. This family has transformed the grand old party into a family affair. In which part of the world a party president's job remain secure after an election debacle like 2014? Everybody else in this world has to prove himself or herself in order to enjoy power -- it seems rules are different for Gandhi family.

When would we learn to teach our child that ""no matter what his/her family background is, he can be prime minister of India if he really deserves it"". The truth is we never deserved independence from British. Sycophancy is in our blood. Servitude is in our DNA. We always longed for a king -- a mighty king who is not a common man - so that our king can rule us and we can concentrate on our daily affairs. Democracy is not for us. Let us declare India to be a monarchy and put Rahul Gandhi in her throne -- this would satisfy a lot of people I guess. I feel ashamed to claim our country to be a Democratic one. If Rahul Gandhi wasn't Gandhi and just Rahul, Would we still troll him the way we do now? Just a genuine question! > He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves. And never used pity politics to gain votes.

BS. He is there because his title is *Gandhi*. He's even *using* his sister to win election. Fearing defeat his sister eventually run away. What a disgrace!! You have very little or no knowledge of Nehru-Gandhi family. Kindly don't promote this family members.

Congress has completely failed against Modi-AS duo gang. RG can't even talk cohesively for 30 mins about demonetization, or botched GST or current economic situation, unemployment, farmer issues, healthcare, education, international relation, etc. There are so many issues, but he can't talk with a alternative plan. Like Modi, most of his answers are scripted and they are boring. He himself out on bail.

Congress has no vision, other than its dynastic demands. If Congress has to survive they need to find out another PVNR or MMS. They need to reject Gandhi family and reinvent itself. I'm no fan of modi and I align with a lot of Congress' recent policies but come on..

>And never used pity politics to gain votes.

Really? I've seen him mention that story multiple times at many rallies when he's spinning off his *I'm all about love* message.

>when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life

This is called an *appeal to extreme fallacy*. Some one or two among a million, hit below the belt and make fun of his dad's assasination (making fun of his dad's dumb policies doesn't count). It happens in public life. You can't use those extreme examples to justify the opposite extreme, which is that he is now magically good and deserving of sympathy.

He's a rich tosh who had a tragedy. There's plenty of others with much worse tragedies who don't use those to gain sympathy like he does, so cry me a river. Just a couple of decades ago, people had to go to jail and face torture for having a different political belief.

People laugh at him because he wants the highest job in the country with no qualifications or management experience, without even visiting his constituency for years, and he doesn't even seem to want it himself. You can't just spin the story around and say that everyone laughing at him is now an asshole because his dad was assasinated. Those are two different things. >I dont support Congress, but lets not insult or let neech aadmi's insult and hurt those soft spots.

lol the irony of it. Sanjiv and Rajiv were responsible for the deaths of thousands of minorities. Rajiv sent the IPKF to meddle in Sri Lanka and got nothing to show for it. IPKF was accused of war crimes. It is best not to talk of Indira who though India was her jagir. I have no sympathy for Congress or Rahul for that matter but that doesn't mean I will support BJP. I have had two deaths in my family too... one can recover. Teenagers are more resilient than people think. My take away from that trauma was that if you give up at that stage, it will be your own fault, and no one will be able to help. See I have thought of this, but the issue with that notion is that he doesn't know how to talk or connect. You have such a huge connect via this story to the Indian population but you don't.

He is plain simple not smart enough to be a leader and lives off his name. I joke this with my friends in whatever way RaGa is perceived with his being bullied around, being sent to a foreign boarding school at a young age and his episode with his Dad and Grandma he can change the perception any day. And with that image, he can easily become the PM You do bring some good points.agreed . He deserves respect.

However, I am done with dynasty politics. We cannot afford to have the prime ministership passed on as a royal jewel. Look. So many political leaders faced such issues throughout their lives. So many have overcome their problems and we have to respect them. But consider the privilege Rahul Gandhi has. He has a very powerful family who will swoop down to make sure he leads a luxurious life. How many of our common people have that? His only qualification is that he is son, grandson of two PMs and he hopes to become the PM just because of his tragedies. There are other leaders who worked their ass off for their political careers. They deserve better. This is not the medieval age. Exactly, i truly despise modi and his party of goons and fear mongering buffoons, but at the same time, i see no future with RG becoming PM, dude has no credibility in regards to that, only if congress looked past their dynasty politics and made someone like shashi tharoor the PM candidate, I would vote for congress in a heartbeat. I think you are mixing a lot of things here. And I agree with you that today's politics has reached new low levels and all our politicians are indulging in is mudslinging ... and no constructive discussion is happening.

Now to my disagreement with you ... on his family being dragged into the political debate

1. His father is a former politician and that too a former Prime Minister - who has contributed positively and negatively to the country.
1. His grandmother is also a former politician and a former politician who oversaw one of the darkest periods of Indian Democratic history.
1. Congress and Rahul continue to ask people to vote for them using the Rajeev, Indra & Nehuru's names


Secondly - on people calling him Pappu

1. This is a guy who's parent, grandparent & great grandparent were Prime Ministers of India
1. By virtue of above points - this guy has had access to best education, and life that can be offered to an individual
1. This is a guy aspiring to become the Prime Minister of this country
1. He struggles to talk and convey an idea or thought while talking
1. He is unable to come up with Policy Points and defend himself

I have had a good education and work in a relatively good area. Considering that he was supposed to have a better life than me, I do have an expectation that he will be better than me in order to become the prime minister. So yes - I will make fun of him when he fails so miserably. Is it double standards? yes - cause I do not have such high expectation of Modi - considering that he is relatively uneducated chai wala and is a cattle goon. Fuck off True as a person I believe he went through a lot, but imo I just can't see him as a leader Congress should break away from silver spoon leadership and give others a chance pretty sure there are competent leaders inside Congress party way deserving than Rahul G ( now don't come at me with whataboutism regarding with Modi).
Everyone is like ""what about Modi then"" let's be clear even if you hate him he play politics well Rahul G don't it's simple as that.

Now coming back I think in coming year Priyanka can be a good leader but still I don't know if I can support silver spoon fed candidates over people like Arvind Or even Modi. I can only imagine the pain he went through. He is in politics and nothing is spared here.

I think he was thrown into politics too soon and his lack of experience in his initial days reflected in his speeches and handling of party work. Congress needs a strong leader at this time and I don't see Rahul becoming one anytime soon. If I am being honest I don't think he is really made for politics. I don't think much of his political activity (so far), but not one politician in India has been scrutinized (derogated, ridiculed and underestimated) as much as he has been. After all that, he is still around & making so-called 'master politicians' tetchy & annoyed is just great to watch. RG has the balls to come out in public and answer tough questions. Unlike somebody we know. There is a difference between personal life and ruling a country i also lost my dad when i was in class 6 that doesn't make me eligible to be so sort of leader that is my personal life. As a person Rahul Gandhi is strong and i respect him but when it comes to ruling a country the case is different. [deleted] It’s really cool for the OP to empathize with Rahul Gandhi IMHO. I never even though of his past and how strong one might have to be to move forward from that. 

That being said, I don’t like the “Pappu” comments not because I support him or think he has the mettle to take on any kind of a leadership role but rather because it does an absolute disservice to the democratic process in India. By calling him “Pappu”, we glaze over his incompetence and inexperience. Someone mentioned earlier that he never had to work for the position and I think that it’s really important for people drill that into their heads.

Basically the outcome of the political scenario is:
1. The only major, non-communal political party is being headed by someone who doesn’t seem to have any achievements of his own other than being born to the most powerful family in India’s history.
2. People still think that because his last name is Gandhi, he has some kind of a privilege to represent the nation. These days I honestly think that Modi is a more accurate representation of what our country is than anyone else. (I am absolutely disgusted by this thought, btw).
3. We either sympathize and excuse Rahul Gandhi or utterly humiliate him. We don’t set attainable goals for the opposition, nor do we converse about what needs to change with all the parties playing the field. It’s always bad vs incompetence.
4. Locking of leadership roles based on nepotistic/mythological values is what has deprived the country of countless leaders  who could have actually made a difference in their communities. This system has blocked individuals access to both resources and potential.


EDIT: accidentally hit submit That doesn't make him a good leader
#Daenerys Politics shouldn't be a family business. Full sympathy with Mr. Gandhi. But he has to learn about the country and countrymen a lot. He might have to learn to become a visionary from other great leaders either domestic or international. Their is learning curve involved he has to go through with it...15 years down the line...he will be a good one to qualify gor PM’s post. At the moment he should lead himself to be a great visionary. I am NOT congress supporter in any way though. Totally non-specific to Rahul Gandhi, but I heard he is running for MP from two different constituencies. If so...how/why is that legally possible? Pappu to Prabhakar. 

He’s actually made an effort this time. Kudos to him. No matter what ppl say Gandhi name is keeping congress party together. This is their only “glue”. Can you see the difference here. Prince Charles and Prince Harry lost their mother too. But their country poured lots of love to them. > close loved ones?

Who are already in short supply for people in his position.

Us nobodies can turn to a lot more people in our circle, relatively. Seriously thats what i was thinking, Rahul ji made lots of sacrifices in his life time and lost his family members in the process, but still look at him! His love for our country is astonishing. After all the tragedies he still want to serve his country. what a legend,he is truly our inspiration. Dhanya ho vo Maata jisne iss saput ko janam diya. [removed] I never hated him but thank you for making me realise this hard part of his life that most of us have forgotten. [removed] And this is something i dont know how the fucking hell nobody understands. But india is ready to insert logic in modi's radar statement.
EDIT: I can see some very great scientists and engineers of our country are getting really offended here.  As inspector Gordon would say :
“It’s because Rahul is the Prime minister India needs, but not the one it deserves. So we’ll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he is a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight!”

If you actually think of it Rahul and Bruce Wayne share a similar character Arc. Both of them lost loved ones, are rich, compassionate and fight goons who want to destroy their respective worlds after all. Also if there roles were changed between modi and Rahul, i’m pretty sure there wont be a day without modi saying my dad and grandmother sacrificed their life for the country, vote for me. Irrespective of how bad your dad is, this is a horrible thing to happen to any kid while growing up, i respect Rahul for that, Modi would have made a hashtag out of it by now and gained sentimental votes > I dont support Congress 

No harm in supporting congress this time. Enough with BJP's ***~~change~~*** [removed] I really appreciate your post. I thought same things but when I shared it with my friends they showed me a video where RG says about potato machine. But one should never forget he never used his father's death as a tool in politics, no matter how inexperienced he is. People who has lost parent would understand this. It's pretty clear for me - if somebody would have asked me who would you hang out with? Rahul, hands down.

Modi is the uncle who just comes into a party and looks around while everybody gets creeped out and stay silent till he leaves. [removed] [removed] Never thought about this. Thank you for pointing it out! Well said. Here, take your gold. [removed] Bro watch akame ga kill He went up and tried to become the leader that the country deserves.
I don't support Congress. 
Dude, really ? maybe he has gone insane but we dont know about it formally Might be off topic but I think Rahul Gandhi is similar to Daenerys Targaryen. Both have powerful fathers who had been at the helm of power. Now both of them are trying to find their place in politics that their family have left them.

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

AskIndia,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",bdfid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record."," Honestly, she and her supervisor behaved *exactly* how most of our government officers behave with residents of India. Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely. As a Canadian, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits. This lady sounds full of shit. Why would an ambassador concern himself/herself with OCI affairs? 

Even if she isn’t lying, it’s worth emailing the consulate/embassy politely explaining the situation and cc-ing the ambassador if you can find their email. If there are multiple consular missions in the country, try emailing them as well. Tweet a summary with some details to Sushma Swaraj , she has helped ppl in similar situations Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through this. You'd think these people would adapt to the local work culture/ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals, which shouldn't be the case.

&#x200B;

Please tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs:  [https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) 

&#x200B;

make sure it's public and that her twitter is tagged in your post. She is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty. Do keep us posted about things you did for this issue. If it is just for a visit, apply for a regular visa. You can always visit India as a tourist. As regards your OCI card application, tweet or send a message to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with your experience. probably you are lying in fine details, or it is shitpost or karma whoring.

as an official, one can certainly say that - an ambassador is too busy to deal with  ""We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds)"" r/iamverysmart individuals.  
moreover, if any of the official encounters technical problems - it is impossible for them to say ""cannot be done because of bad mood"".

I submitted this to /r/rAskIndia a week ago but got no answers. Perhaps some of the good people here may help?

I was reading on the origins of the Gypsies and found this statement:

AskIndia,Recommendations for books on Indian history written by Indians?,avt1qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/avt1qx/recommendations_for_books_on_indian_history/,"Hello r/India.

I'm British and would like to learn more about Indian history, but most of the most prominent scholarship on the subject in the UK has come from non-Indian Brits, and often comes with particular biases (particularly regarding British colonialism). I'd therefore appreciate it if anyone can point me towards good written histories of the country by Indian scholars.

For the history of British colonialism in India I've started with Shashi Tharoor's *Inglorious Empire*, but of course there's a lot more to India's genesis than British imperialism.

AskIndia,What is 'Gotra'?,a2nsgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a2nsgt/what_is_gotra/,"Hey, there's a term quite popular right now in news debate, of 'Gotra' and I don't know what it means, so can anyone tell me about it?
(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)"," In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.

 Basically representing the ancestor.
e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.

Gotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it. Also you can use Gotra to tell from where a particular brahmin is from. That's how it was known Rahul Gandhi's gotra was from Kashmir.

Source: A Brahmin. There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra 'logic':

&#x200B;

*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*

>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman's body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women's nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.

>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed. This is the basis for what I call a 'monogenetic' theory of procreation.

AskIndia,"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",ai7392,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another."," It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are ""spiritual""). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:

1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.

2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.

3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.

Btw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  ""Ramayan"" and ""Mahabharata"". I didn’t find what was the specific question though LOL, spiritual country my foot! Let me quote myself that I've written elsewhere, albeit bit edited. This was specific to issue of legalization of weed but, overall I think I got the point across.

AskIndia,Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends."," You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. 

Quite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.

Having said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.

The real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. 

Eating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.

Regarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.

  


I also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad!",2019-04-19 04:13:12
AskIndia,European looking for opinions from Indians regarding how to make a difficult relationship work,968di3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/968di3/european_looking_for_opinions_from_indians/,"Namaste Redditors, (also posted to AskIndia but I am in need right now)

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

Thank you very much for reading and commenting. "," Hate to break this to you buddy, but you are the third wheel.

The sooner you get out, the better it is for you.

I would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible. Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. 

If there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! 😁 Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.

Now man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.

Don't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.

The responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. 

No matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  

So good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There’s a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  
You just run smack into it. 

She’s just like the majority.

(Most) Indian women simply don’t do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....

Unlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I’m sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her? Well I would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them. In many cases I have seen, Indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely. I would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust. That person can put in a good word to make things easier.
On a lighter note: Watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, it's a similar situation (to some extent). Understandably, she does not want to

Hurt her family's standings
Cause her family grief and pain
Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.... 


The ball is in her court. She needs to think independently and get this sorted. 

On the other hand,  I hope she loves you truly and not just because you're from a European country or for financial independence. You need to make this very clear. 

Please think twice before you proceed. 
Some Indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist. 

Her parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future. I'm also a  minor victim of this. 

 grandkids have fixed some of the relationships. your mileage may vary. Well I am late here. But all the best OP!

I hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you. 

In the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life ( I am sorry but that's how they work in India) and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them, there are possibilities. 

This would be a harsh test of her character and your patience, but I hope you guys come through. Please keep us updated  Move on and break up with her . Help info : where s her family located  ? What is her caste ? If she not willing to STAND UP TO HER PARENTS!!! LET IT GO


I REFUSE To let anyone on this planet/earth dictate who im going to love or marry.",2018-08-11 05:50:06

AskIndia,Who should I vote for in 2019 General Elections?,63l6vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63l6vm/who_should_i_vote_for_in_2019_general_elections/,"Even though I was eligible to vote back in 2014, I was out-of-station during the elections and couldn't be back home in time to vote. I have never voted till now due to similar circumstances. 

Back when UPA I and II were in power, the obvious choice was BJP or its allies. But now that their true colours and agenda are out, my conscience wouldn't allow me to vote for them.

AAP is out of the question as Kejriwal has demonstrated his greed and hunger for power again and again. He keeps allying himself with all the wrong parties in order to protest against whichever the incumbent is.

I will never vote for INC until they change their top leadership and overhaul the party structure as a pro-development secular party with centrist policies.

Who do I vote for?

BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them. 

Are there any good candidate/parties that are not affiliated to the Sangh Parivar/RSS/VHP?

If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state. 

I wish to see India as an educated, liberal and inclusive country that keeps religion out of its government.


**EDIT:** *Should I flair it under Politics or AskIndia?*"," Founders of Indian democracy did not create a model where you vote for a party or the PM candidate. Just because you like Modi/Raga/Kejriwal does not mean all candidates of the respective parties are good. What most people don't realize is by voting for a 'PM' candidate, they are actually destroying the spirit of democracy. 

For general elections, research local candidates all of parties. Find a candidate who is honest, hardworking and has a history of doing good work and raising issues that matter to you. If you blindly vote for a party because you support their PM candidate then you may get a local MP who is useless and will not contribute anything in development on your region. 

EDIT: Typo > BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them.





NOTA. Look at your MP candidates and vote for the best one irrespective of their party... [deleted] Simply don't vote. The current version of NOTA is a joke on us. So not voting is the better option. Doesn't matter    

#EVM ==> Every Vote for Modi NOTA. I know it is useless, but I have to register my dissatisfaction with the quality of options given to us. Ask after 2 years.  I'm voting for AAP because I want to see what that insane man does. India has survived 60 years of Congress and nearly 3 years of BJP. I'm sure it'll survive a Kejriwal.  > If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state.

u lost me here.  [deleted] For me, it's gonna be anything but BJP. They have become too arrogant. Do you have any regional parties prevalent in your state? I'm from Hyderabad so I guess I could vote for TRS. They've been doing great work.  Vote for Priyanka Gandhi if she is next PM candidate  I'll probably try AAP now I suppose. Tried INC -> Didn't work. Tried BJP -> They've done some good IMO, but as of now, they are super distracted. So the only party that is even trying is AAP, so I suppose that gets my vote.

Honestly the demographic dividend problem (and resource) is a very big one that can make or break the country's future. And nothing but a fully-focused push can achieve anything. Even then, it might be far too little , too late, but I'm always a hopeful man, so I'll still believe. But time is running very very low for things to be in place (as is India, we are already way past deadlines), but lets see what happens. [deleted] BJP , there simply isn't an alternative ! If you need to ask others who you should vote for, I think you are an uninformed voter and should refrain from voting. A better idea would be to make yourself informed and decide for yourself.

I personally will probably vote for INC, unless a better alternative comes up, but you should make your decision yourself.",2017-04-06 01:54:57
AskIndia,"r/india, what's your Entitled/Idiotic Indian Abroad story?",cjv92h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cjv92h/rindia_whats_your_entitledidiotic_indian_abroad/,"Most of us must have watched that viral video of the Indian family stealing stuff from a hotel in Bali. Not saying that this behaviour is exclusive to us, but I'm sure a lot of us have witnessed this first hand. What's the worst incident you recall first hand of Indian folks behaving badly abroad?

For me:

1. Our flight was awaiting departure at the Malaysia airport. Suddenly, the weather turned bad and it started raining very heavily on the runway. The pilot announced that there would be a delay of few minutes due to weather conditions. Hardly 2 mins later, this Indian lady - a honeymooner from her looks, gets up and starts yelling at the crew. ""Explain to me what is the issue"", ""what is the estimated time for fixing the issue"", ""Oh so our time has no value after paying so much money?""... BC pakka some IT mid level manager who kept yelling to ""fix issue asap"" at the poor crew. Her husband was of course supportive and joined her in the shouting match. Eventually, it took some co-passengers to calm them down.
2. Possibly the worst people to board a plane could be found on the Bangkok route. Groups and groups of crass middle aged men making lewd comments about the air hostess, or hell, even singing antakshari at night because they thought it'd be funny. Even more tharkis asking their co-passengers where to get the best ""maal"".
3. Seen many people throwing trash on the streets (habit from India), being obnoxious to other tourists (mocking them for their physical appearance or ethnicity) and sharing like 1 beer amongst 5 people. While in Pattaya, a HUGE number of establishments (strip clubs, bars and lounges) turn away Indians for these reasons. If they see brown guys approaching, they just tell them ""Sorry, members only"".
4. Reasonably well behaved in hard-assed Singapore. I wonder why...
5. On a flight to Dubai, after the flight took off, a Muslim guy got up and started looking for something in the overhead compartment. So, this moron sitting next to me calls the air hostess and asks her to check what he is doing. ""Bomb nikla toh?"" he said that so loudly that even the Muslim man heard it. Turns out, the Muslim man was just taking out his lunch box. ""Burger hai bhaijaan, bomb nahin"", he said while getting back to his seat."," Any flight going to Thailand is usually trash. Always filled with a group of obnoxious uncles who are so giddy about getting laid that they literally can't stop chirping throughout the flight.

Thailand in general tends to attract some absolute shit tier tourists, regardless of nationality. Oh man. So there was a huge line in Bangkok for boarding pass and everybody was standing still in line while some impatient people of my own country literally unhinged the rope from the pole and got in between.
Everybody fucking followed and got in the middle. The airline crew had to come and maintain decorum. The white guys just stood surprised. I was at the Chicago airport and some elderly women sitting across me at the gate, loudly, in my native language (Telugu), started gossiping to each other about what I wearing (sneakers, jeans, a t-shirt and a hoodie). After like a minute or two I told them in Telugu I can understand everything they're saying and to mind their own business and they had the audacity to tell me I don't know how to speak to elders. Changing a baby's diapers on an empty seat WHILE PEOPLE AROUND ARE HAVING THEIR MEALS. 

I've never seen a flight attendant so upset; he had to almost drag the mother to the washroom (where they have baby-tending facilities) >even singing antakshari at night because they thought it'd be funny.

What the actual fuck. Cutting into queueus, gets on my nerves every time ! > ""Bomb nikla toh?""

Security check-ins are just a casual formality for him. Not Abroad but an asshole Indian family from abroad spotted at Delhi airport. I landed from Leh and was super hungry and late because my previous flight landed late. This family argues on the counter while taking boarding pass asking for a free upgrade. Upon asking why sir, Have you bought an upgrade ? Their reply was ""actually we're from US"". Whenever I go to india from Tokyo to Delhi via Thailand, the difference between the two legs of the journey is huge... Had gone to Switzerland and there were a lot of Indians. On Jungfraujoch, there was this middle aged guy who shouted in the loudest voice I’ve heard: “IS THIS VEG!?!?” Everyone looked at him but he didn’t give a shit. Since he was evidently not going to apologize, I went and did the good deed. Someone from the same group was trying to score a mini bottle of Red Label for free even though you had to pay for it. Their argument was that “we have bought so much food, we should get one for free.” Eventually the cashier got hella pissed and refused to serve them. 

When I read the the rules that the Swiss hotel had put up, I wasn’t surprised. That’s not racism people, a lot of travelers are just rude and entitled. This didn't happen to me, but when my SO was flying to Dubai, there was a middle-aged Indian man who was sitting next to her (with one seat gap between them). He straight up grabbed food from my SO's meal saying don't mind no? He also proceeded to fight for more free alcohol after having like some four pegs before.

I was glad there was a seat between him and my SO and she got out safely but man, you tend to meet some really creepy people on flights.

I have also seen Indian families just walk to plug points in airports and proceed to remove other peoples charging paraphernalia just like that, without asking them and then put their own chargers there. After that, they proceed to beg saying please please and then hog that port until the end of time. Why is it that as indians we hate to see other indians when we visit some place touristy? Is it just me ? When I go some place and see indians there I get upset and think oh no these fuckers are here too !! On my flight back from Heathrow to dubai(final destination India), there was an Indian lady with her son, sitting on my window seat which I had booked as soon as check ins opened. She said with such entitlement to me that you can sit on the aisle seat. Didn't find it decent to say anything or maybe I didn't have the right words at the moment, I settled into the aisle seat. After sulking within for 10 minutes, I asked her to move back to her seat.

I might have given the seat had she asked politely but the attitude!!! The antakshari point made me cringe inside out Literally, everytime I get on a flight. To or from the us to india, there are obnoxious Indians, who either block the boarding gates even for disabled passengers. While getting off the plane, they dont care if their luggage is banging others and will run over others in front of them. The worst part is when the steward / stewardess bring drinks. They try to hog drinks like its holi. 1. The 'First One Out' game that we guys play as soon as the flight has landed. We all are used to seeing this but it's fun to see the faces of foreigners new to this experience.

2. Drinking beyond limits just because it's free - another thing that we frequently see on International flights. 

3. Not seen most Indians doing this but have still seen a considerable amount breaking queue everywhere possible, be it coffeshops, grocery stores, airport lines, toilets. Was fun to see our fellow countrymen breaking queues for Tube Tickets and the Englishmen just shaking their heads or muttering to themselves since they are too polite for their own good. 

4. Have seen a full blown fight between an Indian group of 7 to 8 and a Pakistani group of nearly the same size in a UK pub. It happened because a guy from one of these groups was acting fresh with a lady from the other; don't know if these individuals were Non Residents though, police had to be involved. Ohhhhhh God there are so many .

 bunch of gujju aunties being reprimanded by an security officer at airport toilet . Apparently they had deviced an unique strategy , where woman who is using the washroom would lock the door with one leg so the next one can go inside after her without paying for each individual use . Like this 8 or more women used to go at same time . They had absolutely no shame on their face , nor do their husband . On the contrary , they seemed proud of the unique idea . I even heard one of them saying proudly ""madam , expert Che""

Why do such people  even travel Europe , Australia etc for vacation . Got on a flight from Abu Dhabi to Ahmedabad in which I was on the window seat next to an elderly gentlemen on my right. He had come before me and once I sat down he started to complain about how unethical and disgraceful it was that the flight had put him next to a girl, lol. He moaned and moaned until a younger gentlemen sat in front between two men asked him to swap seats. So this is in Sydney. Everyone takes the train to get back to the suburbs in the evening. And it's also well known that the train network is complicated, and a signal issue, or a medical emergency at one station can create delays and a backlog for hours. (Trains run every 2-3 min during peak hours). 

During one such day a signal issue at a station meant that every train going in that direction was delayed for an average of 15 min. Every signal was turning green slower than it would. The train I was in was later on and was also majorly affected. We were delayed by 30 min, and the train was stopping every now and then waiting for the signals. 

The train driver kept announcing frequently that he's waiting for the signal and that's why we aren't moving. Also said Sorry for the inconvenience even though it's not his fault. When the train stood for long at a platform he'd open up the doors and say passengers are welcome to stretch out on the platform, and he'd inform when he's ready to leave.

During one such stoppages and Indian uncle got pissed. We were in the first compartment. He got down at the platform and started shouting at the driver for the delay. He said things like ""You may drive a train, I have more important things to do"", and ""its because of people like you, trains are always late"". The driver was patient and just repeated that he cannot move until he gets his signal. 

Uncle was not happy. Kept screaming, and said ""do you think I'm a fool"". An Australian gentleman told him he was a fool and asked him to shut up and defended the driver. 

&#x200B;

And then Uncle says ""My wife will scold me for coming late"". The entire compartment laughed out loud and Uncle lost his voice after that. Saale sab dusron ko dosh de rahe hain, apne girebaan mein koi nahin jhaank raha hai!

T: Everyone is blaming others, no one is introspecting to identify the mistakes they made themselves.

I will tell a story where I was the idiot/entitled one. First time I went to US, I went to my hotel to check-in. The woman at the reception was talking to another customer. There was a slight pause in their conversation and instinctively I thought this is my opening and barged in. She immediately stopped me with, ""Sorry sir, I am talking to this gentleman here"". That was the first time I realized that you are supposed to wait for your turn patiently. On the other hand, when I came back to India, it became evident that this won't always work in India because if you politely and patiently wait for your turn in India, your turn will never come. My worst experience was in Finland last year. I was there on an exchange program with my school and my friends and I were in a club. I was getting a drink at the bar and this Indian dude came up to me and started asking me shit like, ""Yaar firangi ladki ke saath baat karunga to chodegi kya?"". I told him not be a dick. Apparently he was there for a business thing and he worked for Nokia. He started asking me to set him up with some of my female friends (none of them are Indian so he thought this was his chance). I squarely told him to fuck off and not to embarrass himself. Then I stepped out for a bit to take a call while my friends were inside. While I was outside a female friend of mine came outside to tell me that apparently some Indian dude was bugging them and he claimed to be my friend. I ran back in to tell him to fuck off but by then the bouncers had already gotten to him. They asked me if I knew him and I told them everything that happened. They asked me to leave anyway but my friends kinda stood up for me. It was embarrassing as fuck so I left anyway... 

The fucked up part was that, that guy wasn't even drunk. He was just a fucking choot. Was on an Air India flight heading to europe. There was a family with a kid whose diaper was soiled and  was stinking badly (obviously). The kid was still sitting on the seat! But that’s not all. When the air hostess intervened, the father of the child casually said, “No, no it’s fine. We will land in 2 hours anyway.” The most common thing among desis in Western countries is buying stuff with the express intent of returning AFTER using. Many have turned it into an art form - what to say, how to appear belligerent, how to abuse the system shamelessly, etc. Thankfully, the ABCDs (next generation) are thoroughly embarrassed and want nothing to do with their parents' shenanigans. A few recent incidents:

1) I'd been to Yellowstone with family and there are these pools there which have a high concentration of bacteria and they shouldn't be disturbed for ecological reasons. There are SEVERAL signs saying ""Bacterial pool/mats, please do not touch"", but despite this I noticed some full grown adults that were a part of a huge Indian group touch and splash the water around. If not for the sake of the environment, at least have the common sense to not touch water that is literally filled with bacteria!! The most embarrassing scene was when this young Chinese child who was also a part of the tourist group shyly point to the sign and say ""no no"" that these adults noticed and didn't pay heed to. I'd finally had enough and approached these people and asked them to move away from the water because they weren't allowed to touch it after which they reluctantly moved. Looking at this scene this old white guy who was walking by mumbles ""Fucking tourists"". 

2) There's a park near my place where kids play and adults walk around in the evening. At the same time this huge group of aunties, I'm guessing housewives convene near the play area which is usually so silent and peaceful and start a racket loudly in Hindi/Punjabi, while their kids play. Laughing and gossiping about random things.. it's such a nuisance. No one's asking them not to talk, but maybe call your friends home and host the racket. I will never understand why it's so difficult for people to just fit in and behave like people around them.. The ""Why fit in when I was born to stand out"" quote has been taken too literally some some of them.

I haven't seen too many people misbehave here though.. what annoys me more is how they behave like law abiding decent citizens here and the second they return to India, throw garbage around, and behave badly. You come here and see how clean and beautiful everything is and after living here for a while, they sure as hell know how to maintain such a place, then why do they behave badly when they get back? Because ""Eh it's already dirty, nobody follows the rules anyways, everyone honks anyway so why shouldn't I do the the same"". A guy yelling at the Air hostess for not helping with his bags. His reason: he has heart issues and its her duty. He was so proud bitching about her the whole way that I felt so bad being an Indian. He even complained about her to all her co-workers. Never been abroad, so no stories to add here but that last one hurt. Well I live in Singapore but I swear Indian tourists(mostly) when alighting from the plane in either countries(or even other countries as a matter of fact) are in such a hurry like the doors are not open have some patience please

Also not to mention the loud talking. If u understand an Indian language u can easily know what they are talking about 1. Airports! Always! Worst one was at Charles De Gaulle, a flight to India, and the passengers had crowded the boarding gate, and were not willing to go sit down and line up according to groups. The gate staff were initially nice, then they got a bit firm, but the passengers were not relenting. The crew had to finally bring out the pilot or co-pilot, who was a Sikh Indian, who had to yell at them in Hindi to sit, and behave orderly, or they would hold up boarding.
2. Walking around some markets in Munich with my husband, we were minding our own business. This desi looking uncle, with his wife and kids is at the same stall. Suddenly starts chatting with us, which is fine. We exchanged pleasantries, then this peacock starts to tell us how he is an American citizen, has a big house in New Jersey (lol, who says that to a stranger), kids are US citizens, and some other supposedly-braggy bullshit. He only stopped when I told him we lived in Orange County, California. Cause apparently that one-upped him. This is why I dont like to talk to stranger desis. Its always a ""whose-dick-is-bigger"" contest.
3. I pre-select my seats on a flight, for personal reasons. Once on an SG-Mumbai flight, there is me in the aisle, a desi guy in the middle, and Indian aunty in the window. As I am arranging my luggage overhead, she makes an arrangement with the guy in the middle seat. Guy in window, me in middle and her in aisle. Why? Cause ""baaju mein gents aa gaye na"" She wont sit next to gents, but its ok for me to. (TBH i dont care, but hypocrisy much?). Then she said bathroom jaana padega. I said I'm ok to get up for you to go. She only relented when I told her I paid $20 to ensure an aisle seat, and she could have it if she gave me $30. 
4. If you sit in the back of the plane on a flight to India, you will notice, the red label will never reach you. The uncles will always finish it before service is over. :-P

Having said that, this ridiculous, entitled behaviour is almost always uncles and aunties. I've met some really nice people in their 20s and 30s who always talk about general things, offer travel advice and share their experiences. I always have problem with north indian groups traveling abroad. They are very loud in flight and they look down on Telugu/Tamil people. And also their funny English accent on a flight to Europe is more cringy. A (maybe) newly married couple complained about their pizza having only tomato sauce and cheese and ""none of the other toppings we get at Dominoes or Pizza Hut"". At a pizzeria. IN MOTHERFUCKING ROME, ITALY. [deleted] 1. On a flight to Singapore an oldie Aunty (50-55 years) and a middle aged man (Late 30s-early 40s) start chatting loudly in what sounded like Marathi to my northern ears. This was after the meals had been served and lights turned off on a 12 hour flight. A few old Australian passengers who were trying to sleep asked them as politely as one can to speak a little less loudly. The old lady went nuts with the usual,”We have also bought a ticket, we will talk as we like...blah blah”. The other passengers just pay back on their seats as if resigning to their fate. I don’t know why they didn’t call the flight attendants. 

2. There is loud and then there is Punjabi loud; and I know this because I’m one. A Punjabi Aunty in the seat ahead of mine talking loudly over the phone, telling the person to take in her ‘kachera’ (Punjabi for kuccha/underwear) on the washing line because it seemed like it was going to rain. This was just before takeoff and she didn’t shut up until the stewardess asked her to. 

3. On a Cathay Pacific flight full of Indians travelling from HongKong to Delhi a Sikh uncle (mid/late 30s) probably from Delhi asked the stewardess to carry his duty free wine in her luggage so he didn’t have to pay any duty on the load of alcohol he was carrying. The rest of the passengers were such a pain as well, as they kept walking around and not sitting down even after the pilot’s announcement that they were about to land. One guy kept trying to access his carry luggage when the seatbelt sign was on, for some reason until the male steward gave him a firm talk. The stewardesses were holding their heads in their hands. 

Many such stories but if you are one of the more enlightened ones, please go out of your way to change this image of uncouth, loud and rude Indian traveller. It might not be your making but it affects you as much as it will affect the people who are responsible for it. My worst flight ever, my personal flight from hell. AI Paris to Mumbai, December 14th, 2003. I took AA from Chicago to Paris, what I didn’t know was the AI flight was also Chicago to Paris with a layover in Paris. 

When I got on, a gujju lady was beside me with her granddaughter. She made a make shift camp bed infront of our legs for her kid. I’m 6’2, it was impossible for me to move. As a meek 17 year old then, I didn’t say a word, not that it would matter anyway, she didn’t know Hindi, first time I realised not all Gujarati people speak Hindi. I even filled out their immigration leaflet before deboarding. 

I worked at a hotel in Mauritius for an year, surprisingly not many entitled Indian stories, even though 50% of our guests were Indian. My opinion:
1. Pure overreaction, can’t point this as Indian behaviour.
2. Ughh,  hate such idiots
3. Only beatings can cure such things
4. May be only such people get a pass to be there
5. While many country tourists are stereotyped for their behaviour and this one is just typical Indian. Indian family in an American restaurant they act like they are entitled to everything and act they literally own the restaurant. I work in a fine dining restaurant and we have jazz music every Wednesday. The family walked in demanded Indian classical be played by the band. WTF..... This is why most servers don't want an Indian table in restaurant and they won't tip no matter what. Was flying back from europe, had two inbreds in the seat behind me. They realised that alchohol on the flight was free and proceeded to hound the air hostess for drinks for the first 2-3 hours. Then once drunk they started watching videos on their phone without headphones. After a couple of minutes other passengers complained to the staff and they finally stopped.

After a few hours of nonsense like this, one of the apes decided that 8 glasses of airplane whiskey didn't agree with his stomach and decided to puke all over the aisle. So for the last 4 hours of my flight I had to deal with the stench of stomach acid and partly digested airplane food. \#5: had it been in US, both of those clowns would've been dragged out for some ""special interrogation"" I was in Australia for an onsite project.
In the community gym ,there was this particular indian women who used to bring her 2-3 year old grand kids to the gym . These kids were quite a nuisance.
 
I once told her that if your grandkids aren't interested in gymming ,then why are you bringing them . Her reply was ' Humne bhi paisa bhara hain , aap Kaun ho bolnewale '. i dont know about abroad but in hyderabad one guy standing in 10th row was pushing everyone to get ahead as soon as the plane landed. I tried to stop him but he pointed to his wife, I let him go thinking she was unwell. When i got down i saw him clicking selfies with his wife in front of the bus. Let's be honest, all countries/nationalities are assholes. Just see how white people go to developing countries and beg for us to fund their ""finding themselves"" trip

I know it's a lil whataboutism, but other countries already hate us. Just see how white people on Reddit are very quick to point out that we smell of Curry and spices, when they themselves can't properly clean their asses and smell of poop (bidet masterrace> toiler paper)

Seriously, don't get into this self hate thing. Majority of Indians are respectful, it's basically numbers game. If 10% of uk is annoying, thats 6 million. If 10% of India is annoying, that's 150 million I've seen a lot of us haggle the people from customer service for free upgrades/meals/discounts. The game plan is simple ,doesn't matter if its flight or a hotel or any other place in the hospitality industry. 

They go in with the cheapest plan/ticket/reservation and then look for some god damn stupid reason to complaint to the customer service reps. They wont stop stop complaining/arguing till they get something free, it could be a better room, better seat on a flight, free meal anything. 

And the worst part is that once they get something free of cost they will go and brag about this to their friends and family as if they did something great. Its so annoying listening to people and their cheap adventures. Number 3. as mentioned by OP, legit happened to me and a friend, the first time we were in Pattaya,we were turned away from a couple of establishments and when it made sense that this is because of being Indian we were extremely shocked. We had no other option but to show Australian ID and currency we were carrying to show that we came from Australia. Whenever I made friends with foreigners online they would, without fail, comment on how different I am from the Indians they see. It's an easy halo effect, so I don't mind. This was from Holi last year. There is a very nice little stretch in Jersey City, US ( one in the kal ho na ho ) and it’s really nice to just sit out there and look at the NYC skyline at sunset. 

Imagine my horror to see holi colors all over the deck and it’s just not isolated, there was pichkari stains and gulal and it was just disgusting. I mean fucking play holi but clean up after your mess. It was really disappointing to see that there are so inconsiderate people. Long line at immigration point at Helsinki Airport. A pair middle aged woman and man pushing and showing through the line to get in front loudly proclaiming ""we are senior citizens."" With that stupid hand gesture and head wobble. As if being senior citizen means something in Scandinavia. Get a bloody free wheelchair if you can't stand or walk. Going down from Zugspitze, Germany by cable car, this huge group of middle aged Indians shouting on top of their voices, ""How's the josh?...High sir!"". Was super embarassing to share the cable car with them smh. lol this thread is depressing I was on my flight from Jeddah(KSA) to New Delhi. Once on board flight attendant started handing out blankets to anyone who have asked. As soon he started distributing literally every Indian around started shouting on him Sir ji me, sir mujhe bhi, me me, here, sir here etc. it was so loud that it make everyone uncomfortable. At this point the flight attended said in Hindi, ‘ Bhai, yeh khana nahi hai’. Guess what, attendant was Russian. I've got something similar on three occasions;

1. I've travelled every year of my life since I was born as my parents lived and worked abroad. So, I've witnessed all sorts of chaos and woe that Indian's occasionally, bring in flights and the regular things like standing in the aisle even before the plane has come to a stop etc.I remember recently on a flight from the middle east a few people got up and made a queue before the seatbelt signs were turned off and the plane was still moving. One man sitting near the door, told them to stop making the queue so early and they said we've been waiting to return to India for a few years and he responds quickly, ""Jab saalo wait kar liya to do minute me kya jaiga tumhara. Baith jaiye.""On a few flights, I'd see people bring in luggage greater than the weight allotted to them and in order to evade the extra baggage fee, they'd stall the line for boarding pass and ask if they can check-in their luggage with us as we generally packed light for frequent travel. If we've had reached our luggage limit and politely refuse, they'd ask the next guy in line.
2. I was returning via bus from LA to SF and there was written baggage limitation on the bus ticket of two bags. It was also explicitly mentioned in bold red that no leeway would be given for extra baggage.Then comes this news reporter and her mother with six huge suitcases. Everyone has handed over their luggage and got it stored in the storage of the bus. I was travelling with an Indian friend at the time, we had one suitcase each. We're queuing up to get onto the bus and she's there arguing with the bus conductor. He refused to entertain them. He told them to either get on the bus or get off.She then seeing us in the queue comes to us and asks if we have luggage left to check-in. I agreed as it was delaying the bus departure and she got her way.When we went to the bus conductor he looked at us and then said that every time an Indian would come and they'd always exceed the luggage limit and we shouldn't let her get her way. I said, we're also Indian and if we have space, then do this once and we can depart quickly.We made the reporter promise to the conductor that she'd not check in more luggage on her return journey. She got all happy and gave us her business card, a reporter for some big News TV corp. We didn't care. But, the delay she caused in departure made everybody very angry with us. My friend even said, ""Jaane do inko! Phasne do! India smajh baithi hain ye log!"".
3. This one was unique; There was a guy adamant about smoking aboard the plane while in flight. Flight attendants and people will keep telling him to stop. He'd put out the cigarette and then light it again after some time. The flight attendant snatched his lighter he was hiding and cigarettes. Asked for his passport and visa. He was then promptly arrested upon disembarkation as soon as he was through the immigration check.

Please, everybody, when you travel, make sure you read the rules on the tickets ahead of the journey. There's been quite a few occasions when I witnessed Indian travelers acting really stuck up and entitled and treating service personnel like crap, though that mostly applies to the middle income crowd.  Try flying business or first class and every Indian passenger would make an average Westerner look like an uncivilized savage.  Switch to cattle class and everyone acts like they're one of the Great Mughals and demands they're treated as such. We were in Athens boarding the metro from the airport to the city. Since it was the first station, the train was stopped till its departure time. An Indian uncle was standing near the open door (just outside) and smoking. At least two announcements were made saying that the train is about to depart, so please board. This guy just put one leg inside the train and waited. Then the doors started shutting, and he tried to claw the door open  multiple times. Since the doors weren't shut, the train couldn't leave, and he wasn't strong enough to claw them open completely. He finally managed to wriggle his leg outside, and the train was able to leave. There is a statue called The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen, Denmark. I saw grown-up Indians trying to climb the statue (not too tall) to pose for a picture. Was on a flight from Dubai to LA and had a bunch of Telugu uncles (they tisko-cheezeko-ed their way to cowboy land) in the row behind me. They really were having a ball and seemed to be first time travellers based on the way they were trying to enjoy everything to the hilt. What really irked me was the way they would keep calling the hostesses - we were sitting very close to the pantry area, so they would just hail, ""Aye, babbyy, waater waater"" or ""Aye, bebbie, 3 beers"" or Aye, babbee, some chicken/nuts aa?"" since they wanted their drinks and chakna on their laps whenever their hearts desired. One of them would replace ""babbyy"" with ""medam, medam"". And do note, they didn't seem to use those words deridingly (no followup laughter and all) - they just seemed to know that those were the words to refer to a non-desi woman. What baffled me most was how the hostesses seemed to be completely okay with those calls and would respond to them every time with smiles and actually even serve them what they wanted. All that just confused and irritated the shit outta me and I did nothing but just sulk. ""Burger hai bhaijaan, bomb nahin"" would also be an appropriate line to say after one rips out a nice fat one, which is quite common from our countrymen and women on such long flights, what with all the airline food and beverages floating inside. Indian uncles and aunties eating Biryani, Roti, Curd rice, Lemon rice in NYC near the charging bull statue. That's the worst thing I have ever seen because lot of other tourists come to that place. What's wrong with sharing a beer? Man the first story made me so mad . Why doesn't the DGCA start banning these entitled fucks from flying? A few years ago me and my father were at this pizza place in Arizona where you need to put your own boxes in the trash,and we saw this massive Indian family just leave everything on the table and then go. It was so embarrassing,the staff looked very incensed. My dad went over and apologized for their behaviour. There was a time when I came to know I was the idiot . 

So I was just walking in a town in South East Asia and I saw a girl selling fruit salad . I just said  her get me one in a loud tone just like we do in India and she was pissed like anything . I realised my folly when I saw a Caucasian couple buying the same stuff with so much civility . 

When you are travelling in a group , the whole group is as civil as the most uncivilised person . We went to a French bakery and they had this number plate on table system . Our girls went so crazy with selfies , food pics etc , it was literally a Commotion . French staff was really kind and just pointed out that please make sure that number is visible. 

To be honest , these white people overdo stuff. To much of ""Thank You"" but we need to be more humble as well. I was on a flight from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi, flying the new (at that time) Etihad Airbus A380 which is basically a double decker. The bottom I think was all economy and the top was business and the really fancy first class apartment style seats. A lot of people in economy were really curious to see the apartment style seats and asked the crew to allow them to go up there and they were obviously denied since that would disturb the passengers up there. 

When we reached AUH, everyone had to exit to the front of the plane where there also happened to be stairs to the top. A flight attendant was standing there to ensure that noone strayed to the top. As I was exiting, right in front of me was an Indian man with his perhaps 8 year old son. We could hear the attendant telling a lot of people on their way out that they wouldn't be allowed up there, so even though I was curious myself, I had decided I wouldn't ask to go up. 

As we got to where the attendant was standing, someone from the other aisle asked him a question and he turned to deal with them. The man in front of me, seized this opportunity to try and sneak past the attendant. He started climbing the stairs along with his son and had one eye on the attendant the whole time to make sure he didn't turn. The attendant did of course, soon turn, and had to give this man a dressing down. 

It was soo embarrassing.....a grown man getting told off in front of his son for not being able to listen to simple instructions, as if they apply to everyone but him :/ Well, mine must be the battery Park in new York City. All of us are waiting in line, when a Gujarati family, a old batshit crazy mother and her two sons decide that they are too good to be waiting with us peasants, so they literally go under the tape only to be stopped by security and given a surprise *insert surprised Pikachu face* that they're in the United States, not India. Then the sons try to cuss and scream at the female security guard (they're probably not frequent tourists and haven't got accustomed to the concept of female security guards) about random stuff and how they're gonna sue her of all she's worth. She calmly calls the cops on them and they are dragged away in a NYPD police car, with handcuffs, while the whites are muttering stuff about Indians under their breath, and my girlfriend and I are praying to whatever God exists that we look non Indian enough, and start talking in Japanese for everyone to hear. What I find frustrating on every inbound flight from Asian destinations.. People scrambling to get their bags out of overhead luggage compartments as soon as the plane lands and is taxiing..no one gives a fuck about safety and create total chaos putting the crew in a difficult place... It's not like you are getting anywhere till the doors are opened. Hate that such nauseating actions reflect poorly on the rest of us pleasant folk. >4.....

I really think this should be far more common around the world.  Caning is quicker, cheaper, and people will definitely remember it more than a fine. I do want to clarify, not all Indians behave like this. Just a few from rural areas and some uneducated. There are many decent Indians who do not do this. The later are increasing by the day as more people immigrate to urban areas and education increases. Stay where you are mate.",2019-07-31 07:13:00
AskIndia,"So I am writing a book, titled ironically ""Letters from your BFF"" in response to Nikita Singh's ""Letters to my ex"".",9b5g5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9b5g5p/so_i_am_writing_a_book_titled_ironically_letters/,"Hey everyone, I have flaired the post AskIndia, because I am seeking a conversation about absurdities of relationships and interpersonal friendships in today's world. 

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here:

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.


"," I read the first five months. Your notes are quite interesting. Do you make similar notes for other books that you read?

AskIndia,We really need to talk about Flairs.,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  "," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",2017-05-16 02:51:16
AskIndia,"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",4qepvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

"," >Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

It might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. 

>What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

These things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  

My personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. 

At the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage. I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. 
There will be problems and bitter feelings initially. 
Your first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? 
If you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. 

Stand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. 

Good luck! 

Edit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again?  > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

If arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

This is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.

It frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.

So if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their ""prestige"" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision. I can't answer this question. But you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about non-trolling answers.  If someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldn't be marrying the guy anyway.

Just my .02 rupee. Here is what i think , I think you are making a mistake. Leave her now.

Here is why?

If you wanted to be with that girl , absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter. No one and i mean no one has a right on your future life. You and your partner have to be the only ones to decide. So even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked, i posit that you are not really into her.

Drop it now, not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her.


 Honor Killing is a possibility... They'll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the ~~goats~~ gaus.. 

But seriously.. Fuck the orthodoxy.. If you want Indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows.. 

Screw your parents.. (Not literally).. Your sister will be fine.. Its not like she's gonna be married the next day of your own marriage.. 

Chill..Marry...Repent..  Evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one. If the answer is yes, other things don't matter. 

Time heals everything and when your parents/relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position.  Editing a few spelling mistakes. > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

Yes it will, Rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this. Both my sisters are Married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my Dad because of this (I am not pushing for Marriage, my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done.). But the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch, one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family. So that's that. If you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own, then don't worry.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Asshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years, after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing. If you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your GF then do go ahead and not let the Samaj bother you. If you are both outside India, then why don't you marry there. Nobody will really care in a few years.",2016-06-29 23:21:13
AskIndia,[Shower Thought] Subsidies and cheap favours by political parties make people happy enough to vote those parties most likely because people have low standards due to poverty.,6voqzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6voqzs/shower_thought_subsidies_and_cheap_favours_by/,"Think about it.

Not sure if it's the same as your thinking, but here's an article about how farm loan waivers don't help in the long run. Helping everyone is the best way to get votes. We are studying foreign policy this sem. This is the point my teacher makes again and again. Indians are so busy with basic issues that the other issues including foreign policy are ignored. It is one of the reasons that the Indian foreign policy is so non aggressive. It is hard to distract the public with basics when there is a war going on. Compare that to that of the US where foreign policy is one of the issues of presidential debate. I know it's unrelated but we did it in class today and I just wanted to share.

And we really need some new flairs.  > Rich people don't need subsidies.

AskIndia,PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc. 




TLDR: Nope! Read it."," Okay, for whom this is directed towards?  [removed] Does it actually help? Just asking out of curiosity,  I feel it's just another unnecessary step which has no real purpose and is a pain for mobile users,  * please don't ban me :D *  > TLDR: Nope! Read it.

AskIndia,"[Ask Reddit]Please advise, Balding and like a girl.",5hdfdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5hdfdd/ask_redditplease_advise_balding_and_like_a_girl/,"Hi, Randians. This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.
*Edit: Kindly ignore the [askreddit] in the title, wanted to write ask india:)

**Second Edit**: Sorry if i came across as childish or immature. Truth be told, i was drunk when i made this post and perhaps it impacted my replying to some of the posts. Some of you have suggested  
to talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week. My birthday is in Feb. and I pray to God that by that time i would be able to invite her to my b'day party. I will give an update, irrespective of the result. Thanks to all for your suggestions, it really means a lot :)"," Are you good looking and bald ? 

Are you  6 feet ?

>well settled for life in a secure job

This is more than enough. 

And don't worry about bald. Work with what you've got. Make that work for you.

i mean you have clearly demonstrated you are  person of means. quietly go for what sehwag sir did and regrow the silky smooth hairs on your balding patch. ( find a way to excuse yourselves from your GF )


BTW nobody knows what your girl thinks? maybe she is not really into your appearance only and may come to terms upon new knowledge about your balding head. 

so there are two ways given above. sehwag sir ki clinic ka address twitter DM me poochna, aajkal wo baato ke chakke marne me champion hai.  [deleted] > I am hopelessly in love with a girl  
    
No, you're not.  Balding like a girl? Is that in anyway different from balding like a guy? /s Tell her but don't take it to your head, you know, whatever she says. She's just another girl. Also the hair on your head has little to do with attractiveness. And you'll get over the ""feeling"".

Confidence is the key not some filmi love  Saar, pliss to give me her number so that I can talk to her since you don't seem to be very interested. Talk to her for fucks sake or forget her.

- Alt a) If you got the stomach for it: Clean cut. Don't have her in your life. You'll miss her and it will hurt for a while. But the pain numbs after about 6 months, soon you'll move on. 

- Alt b) Remember: we most regret chances we never took. You say she knows you like her. Well, then you making a move will not surprise her; she might even like it (small chance). Ask her out, go have a few drinks, see what happens.  Dude if u think balding is a problem, then life has got some nasty surprises in store for you. You say you are well settled. Have you ever thought about the millions in this country who do not even have a proper meal everyday and are forced to sleep in open in this cold weather? I suppose not.

Yeah and not just the subreddit.  For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .

My wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :

-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. 

-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)

-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.

-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.

or

-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.

On an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. 

Thats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.

If we could just tone down our condescending attitudes,maybe more people will start contributing on /r/india. Now what is seen is comments of same set of people on almost every post. that's exactly the problem with India,we have schemes and schemes of things,but no follow up to the end. /r/kannada Rarely Active?

AskIndia,"NEED HELP - People working in the IT Sector who have absconded a company in the past, can you please share your experience afterwards?",9afobq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9afobq/need_help_people_working_in_the_it_sector_who/,"I joined a MNC as a fresher with a 2 year bond of 1Lakh rs. Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

I know it's a long post but I need some suggestions.(I have been all over internet and discussed with other peers but couldn't decide on a final thing). Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

PS: I posted this in r/AskIndia already but couldn't get many answers. Hope this post gains more attention this time."," Even though your post is very long, the job you are thinking of switching to is not mentioned properly. Do you already have a company (to switch to) in mind or just going to join wherever you get? 

In my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview. At the end, it's all about what they think about you in the interview. If they think that your 6 months was productive, it doesn't matter whether you have a document or not. Though I did not abscond, I had a couple of rough exits from some companies, I told it to Wipro, they called the company which I worked for and truth was twisted.... and I lost the job offer from Wipro, the HR in Wipro told me, better dont show it, because no company wants an employee with a bad history Just be honest and upfront. Why hide?. 

Say I worked there, had excellent training and learnt a lot. Unfortunately, my project did not give me enough intellectual challenge and did not fit well in my career roadmap. Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.

Why complicate things?. If the company that you are targeting gets bothered by that approach, you need to ask yourself, do you really want to work for them. 

I don't think anyone will have time to really digg into what happened in those 6 months, rather they will spend time assessing if you are good enough for the job. And will you have clear free mind answering questions constructively instead of having something back of your mind like what if they find, what should I tell etc etc.",2018-08-27 03:23:51
AskIndia,Buying an apartment in Hyderabad,8dg2ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8dg2ih/buying_an_apartment_in_hyderabad/,"Hi everyone,
I am planning to buy an apartment in Hafeezpet. The total amount is 47 lakhs for ~1100 Sqft near main road. Is this normal price? I am not so keen on buying but my parents in India are adamant about it. Rent expected is around 15000 + 1500 maintenance. Planning to take a loan for 30 Lakhs and use cash 20 Lakhs.

Edit: I don't know why I am getting downvoted :( I just asked a question with the AskIndia flair!"," When you said “Parents in India” I am assuming you are abroad. Actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs(chennai), but I didn’t . I don’t know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.

1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.
2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.
3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. 
4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.
5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.

Is it worth it?? Meh....

This is just my thought...... Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.


   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.

  You can also check out r/indiaInvestments ask the same thing there maybe those guys could be of more help.

AskIndia,[Mod Post] Introducing new flairs for better organization of content.,3ecyjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ecyjp/mod_post_introducing_new_flairs_for_better/,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

---

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

---

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon. 

---

**Edit:** We renamed the Regular flair to Scheduled to better reflect the purpose of the flair."," [deleted] Yo. Team, I think we need to explain governance better, or force it to have a submission statement to raise the bar for the discussion. You have introduced new flairs. But how do you sort based on them? I see only 6 categories on the right... More Flair Categories: TIL, History/Philosophy/Literature, LongReads, Entertainment/Arts

Color Scheme for flairs: Similar to r/science or r/technology

Theme: Even r/Bharat a mature sub, has vibrant colors, our theme is dull, should have colors which looks interactive. > Governance - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet.

I want to filter them all out! Niyam kanoon toh thik hai, pehle is post ko sticky toh kar do. > Ask India - For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations

AskIndia,"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",3huilc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3huilc/r_updated_wiki_rules_flairs/,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki. 

#Mobile Flairs
* AskIndia: [Ask], [AS], [Askindia],[Help]
* Sports: [SP]
* Technology: [TECH],[TE]
* Food: [FO], [Food]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political]
* Politics: [P], [Politics]"," You guys are increasing your own work and in a couple of days you won't be able to do what you started and then selectively apply rules. Happens every time you still don't learn.  I'm confused.

> * **Link submissions** that refer non-personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a **self-post**

1. A self-post? Do you mean a comment?
2. Do you mean ""non-personal verified"" instead of ""non-personal and verified""?

> Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.

Isn't submission of unverified account anyway not allowed?

And so the only twitter accounts that are allowed for direct link submission are ""non-personal verified"" accounts like @PMOIndia, right? >Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.

In such a submission can the name of the twitter handle be mentioned in the title? Have seen a few such posts in the recent past. All of this is going to lead to  more controversies.  Ok, I almost never checkin here except when I do the odd RDD thread but I cannot believe this kind of policing is still happening!

What kind of a place has this turned into that it's making normal everyday indians who are more worried about the kujhli in their underpants to be this aggressive brand of assholes? Here we go again. More and more poorly thought out rules, imposed on the subreddit without any discussion. 

Indians are political and argumentative people. You mods cannot wish that away with your silly rules. Just let the sub be instead of trying to sanitize the discussions. 

This is a chai stall at a railway station, not a formal dinner in Victorian England.  Why is so much importance being given to political/religious threads? 

Why isn't the 'no low-effort' rule being applied to all the threads and posts? 

Man, either apply the rules uniformly or don't apply them at all and let us decide if something is high or low effort. I have seen the 'no low-effort' rule in other subs too but they apply it to everything. More subjective rules with loopholes as a pre-requisite and a necessary design criteria. 

Now, there is no way to differentiate between these two. 

1. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
2. Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.

So, basically, when our **subjective call** says that the user is ""*Flaming the forum*"", we can insta-ban the user. But, we can use yet another **subjective call** to claim that a different user was just indulging in Political humor. 

Just let this forum be. Why the fuck do we have religious threads This is how you make a Dead Sub. I've seen /r/india's rules worst so far. The twitter rules are fucking irritating.  >This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.

WTF. Why can't you guys just let the sub be as it is without adding new rules etc for even one month?

>Would be renamed to Policy. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government

I don't understand the need for a separate flair for this. Such discussions should be under Politics. [removed] Less objectivity, more subjectivity... I can already see numerous ways in which these rules can be twisted and interpreted to suit a person's personal biases.

>Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.

What criteria will be used to decide whether a comment is low-effort or not? Mods' subjective views?

>asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed.

Okay, so if supporters of a particular party bash another party based on a false report(as has happened so many times), and later on the truth gets posted, can we not ask where the bashers are now? Whats wrong with that? Nice. Also please try and do a full revision of the rules. Like all the rules at one place. Hallelujah!! Thanks for this! Are these rules going live along with post, or are you looking for building up opinion and then implememting it? 
 Agreed with the policy for political threads, but not religious threads. As rational people we should be allowed to ridicule religions. Not adherents, but the religion itself. 

If I wish to call Mohammad a paedophile, Yahweh a genocidal maniac or Indra a pussy-man, there shouldn't be a ban on it.  Could you sticky this, please? >accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions


WTF? Also, /r/IndianPeopleFacebook should be listed under related subs. 

/r/IndianFootball too. Oh, NSFW Indian subs too. Why the discrimination? What about genuine criticism of some aspect of a religion? For instance, me calling radhe maa human diarrhoea posing as a Hindu, rather than, say, calling Hinduism diarrhoea in religion form. So where exactly are you drawing the line?",2015-08-22 03:07:11
AskIndia,[R]Feedback thread the sequel. Results and announcements.,2o2rpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2o2rpl/rfeedback_thread_the_sequel_results_and/,"Dear Subscribers,

Thank you for all the comments and thoughts on the feedback thread. Based on that here are the most popular suggestions and our decisions

**Edit** - **check out the clarification about user's posting history, please**

* Bring back old “United We Stand Banner” - **done**

* New link flairs  to be introduced - 

   * Old article (older than 6 months)

   * Technology (phone reviews)

   * Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)

   * Finance

  * Twitter

  * Sports

  * AskIndia


* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones. 

Thanks!
"," what about flair for **science** lets discuss science articles also , it will be very useful for learning new things  [deleted] >but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation

This is quite a violation, no?

I'm sure you will say that if you want to critique, bring it up within /r/india and not outside? But /r/subredditdrama can, while indulging in schadenfreude, still keep us on our toes instead of giving one the feeling that critique is being swept under the carpet. [deleted] I have hidden the score for 60 minutes for now, but I believe given the traffic in /r/India the comment scores should be hidden for 120 minutes. Thoughts? Can the OP be Highlighted more clearly? Its just a more saturated blue, which isn't easy to figure out. For example, most subs have a Blue Background box behind OP name when submitting comments. Can we at least get some Indian mods? Someone who respects Indian sensibilities? Someone who understands, recognises and agrees with the democratic opinion of the country? 

Actually, I know the answer. Take it up your own modmail. 
 > * Clarification on Flairs

This clarification has been a long time coming. You should have given this clarification *before* banning people from the sub for it. Anyways, better late than never.

> * Score hiding
> * New moderator
> * Repost removal

All good steps. I congratulate the mod team. Why has this thread been posted so late in the night?

Wouldn't the more logical thing be to post it during India hours when most active subscribers are awake? > Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will be holding elections in a few weeks.

So someone like hindusanghi123 will be the next mod now? > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.
 
Nope. It's become a lot more intolerant community which believes in violently criticizing groups of people or people in public but cannot take a personal insult when called to question on it. If you delight in shaming people you don't know from the comforts of your keyboard, it'd be hypocritic not to be ready to take insults in return.

> Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bullshit. So is the unverified twitter account rule.

> Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof , but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here.

Can (and is) abused. Use Meta flair for this.

> Score hiding

The crappiest parochial thought fart someone ever had.

> About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed

What's the problem with them? Bad titling?

> Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit

Absolutely no point to this. Leave it to the user's intelligence.

Adding a question, why is **pure theology** as /u/rahulthewall puts it is **banned** in this subreddit? Isn't this also a sub where history is discussed. A verse of the Rig Veda was banned while an article talking about Hindu mythology in medium.com was allowed. Clarify your stand. If you're supporting banning it in the future, that's stupid.

The twitter flair is a nice idea BTW. score hiding will be awesome. good job mods!

ps. would never want to become mod. too much hardwork. you guys are good keep it up Can you put multiple flairs on the same post? i.e. if I post an article which is more than 6 months old about a political subject - what should I flair it as?   

What if it's a Twitter comment which is political and more than 6 months old?   
 >Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bad

>but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama

Bad

>For instance /r/polandball[6] does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Bad.

Everything else sounds great.
 [deleted] Points are still visible on mobile or if you disable CSS, right?  Are you guys still taking the feedback? If yes then I suggest to NOT include AskIndia flair but instead redirect those to /r/AskIndia. Like /r/europe has on the top.

Also sometimes exact title rule doesn't really tell what is in the article. So for that something like *editorialized* flair should be there.

And now some queries - how much time should we wait for the mods to respond if the modmail is sent? Does *Repost removal policy* apply only to that article from one source or other sources too? Because different sources have difference in how the story is presented >About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.

You don't have to ban all links from these sites. Just the ones that have embedded YouTube/Vimeo videos. 

Also, could you guys have AutoMod notify us every time a comment that breaks the rule is deleted. I use c*unt a lot, and it seems to be a word that is monitored closely. Often I've noticed that my comments carrying the word get deleted even when used in a non-sexist or satirical context. I would like to know if/when any of my comments are deleted. I don't see what's wrong with it.  Thanks for the flairs!

Edit: I still see two flairs only. Not activated yet?

Edit 2: Ah I see.  > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.

> **Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal 
attack? Yes.** 

What the fuck? May I know when are you going to ban words like ""kulcha"" and ""kulcha warriors"" ???  Thanks for the change.  > New link flairs to be introduced -

No kulcha flair? Nice Work , When it will be done ? > We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc

What about those cases in which no reply is received even after several reminders?

> please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. 

Again, you only pick and reply. The community should know if the mods are showing partisanship. 

> Is bringing up a user's posting history can be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

So basically I'm allowed to say one thing today and say something completely opposite tomorrow? > We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india[1] debate

What will be the criteria to select this shortlist? Thanks for the link flairs! That was required. 

Score hiding for an hour is good too. Please extend that to comment scores as well. 

 >New link flairs to be introduced -

Old article (older than 6 months)
Technology (phone reviews)

Could we have a ""Uplifting News"" flair? I have been requesting for this for a while! Plis to include me on mod nomination plij.

I think this sub can use a right of center mod. :P

 >  Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

Can a person abuse himself/herself in the flair? My flair e.g. All I have to say is, please make sure the next mod is not a liberal. ALL of the mods are liberal as of now. Approved  Can we have some information about RTI in the /r/india wiki?


Also why 

> cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india




 Still zero feedback for why the mods seem terrified or simply unwilling to take any action against certain posters of a 'secular'/Leftist political bias with a habit of targeting others and the r/india community as a whole.

Are these posters mods or admins? Is that why they are completely immune and get a blank check to do whatever they like? Please clarify.  BTW mods, I'd appreciate if you applied the 'won't show downvotes' rule for new threads as well, because me and other posters identified as 'bhakts' or 'Sanghis' have been facing very furious and concerted downvote herding from r/india's 'secular' posters and lurkers. 

Every new thread I've posted in the last couple of weeks has been quickly downvoted to keep its score near 0 and usually certain posters keep topping that up every few minutes to ensure it never gets more than a few total votes and stays far off the front page.

I am a salaried software engineer in Bangalore, but I'm also getting offers for freelance stuff. I am mulling over a few of these.

One of them seems promising. Three dudes in US are asking me to help bootstrap their startup, and I think I'd take this one.

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

I am worried about the tax return filing next year. Up until now, I have only filed ITR based on Form-16 from employer. Never had to worry about foreign payment for services provided.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

I am sure there are plenty of you folks here who have faced a similar situation. I google a lot (my google-foo isn't that good), and posted in some CA forum, but no reply.

AskIndia,[Modpost] New Flairs for /r/India and Improving Discussions on /r/India,3de8cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3de8cn/modpost_new_flairs_for_rindia_and_improving/,"Hello folks!

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)
"," Could you improve wiki? Many times a post/comment is removed citing some non-existent rule. And you don't allow to make meta post about it. Which I can understand because you don't want drama. You ask to send mod mail. We send but then you don't reply to mod mails too. 

* Remove politics from this sub. Like /r/unitedkingdom has /r/ukpolitics, /r/canada has /r/CanadaPolitics, /r/australia has /r/AustralianPolitics etc remove political post and direct people to post in /r/indianpolitics. It will improve this sub.

* Make things transparent. /r/Futurology has /r/FuturologyModerators/ and /r/FuturologyRemovals/ where removed things are recorded WITH reason. /r/technology has has their automod configuration public /r/technology/wiki/automoderator. Use a meta sub to which allows easier communication and discussions. Case in point /r/metacanada 

* Add this post and other mod announcement posts in the /r/india wiki.  [deleted] >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

If I have to explain my meme or image in a self-post it is kind of counter intuitive, no? 

I mean, a picture is supposed to be worth a thousand words. My two bits:

* Remove the political post/politics altogether from this sub.

 our life is teeming with enough politics already be it newspaper or news channel with blaring mindless debates airing all day. And since many redditors have complained about the same in many self posts it seems like the right time to do so.
You can direct those who wants to discuss that to something like /r/indiapolitics if it exists or make one for them like many other countries sub did , if still you see people have this great uncontrolled urge to discuss which politician wrote what on twitter and those other shit you can always give them a warning first and if they don't comply then ban them from this sub(not shadowban,let them know why they are banned).

*  I'd suggest some flairs like **arts, sports and religion**. More flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably won't downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people. +1 for no political twitter spam > Remove low-effort political self-posts

Please elaborate on this?

Also, you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your process. >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

I don't think this serves any purpose at all. The reason these memes and tweet links exist is not for OPs to score cool karma points, but to reinforce his/her own political views. So self post or not, these low effort posts would continue to clutter the feed. 

>Remove low-effort political self-posts.

You will need to elaborate on this or else you are going to get accused of muzzling opinions.  Since there is an announcement, I want to bring up couple of points which affects the quality of discussion here.  These are tangentially related.             
Does this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? Is it a place for discussion only or reddit India supported activism?  For example Net neutrality debate. I think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl. It encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices.          
I think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like NN which lead to brigading in real life.  Shouldn't have happened.            
Second, do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? And is there a criteria. I  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted. I  see that as an encouragement. 
 Ooh.. common account as a mod.. 

*interesting*

Governance flair sounds good. Hopefully we'll have more discussions on that.
 How about a flair to seperate the faking news/unreal times articles from the real news. > Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Yes and yes. >but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this.

Any other conditions? Wheeee flairs!!   
TIL, LPT/jugaad, ELI 5, ITAP, TOMT, throwback for old awesome posts that newcomers can enjoy like out of loop.     

But can we also have something against down voting self posts into oblivion?     
 [removed] You people tried to moderate political thread last time as well it didn't work. Politics is the major subject on this sub and unless you double the moderators keeping political posts strictly r enforced will be hard.  [removed] Having to explain memes kind of spoil the fun. And that also kind of deters the content makes (Who am I kidding, no randian makes original content). Even then, atleast its possible in the future. Aand thats how you make a dead sub...btw instead of these useless flairs why not make a ""Delhi"" flair to filter it out all the useless AAP posts. I have a moderation related questions.   

When Moderators delete a post, I have seen 3 kinds of things happening.

1. A comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   
2. A [deleted] message appear on the self post    
3. Sometimes neither of the 2 happen, but the post still disappears.    

So what's the difference? Why not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation?   
 Add a flair for geopolitics.  AskIndia is good but I don't think Governance flair would be used often. Rather, have a Weekly flair for regular posts. Another suggestion, have a BJP/AAP/Congress flair along with Political. A lot of people want to read political news not related to these 3 parties.  Rules rules and more rules....At this rate One day you will have to delete all political posts and move it r/IndianPolitics  > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. 

no direct submission to posts made by verified twitter handles makes no sense. make this rule about unverified twitter handles.

verified twitter handles serve as news source, and you have policy of not editing the news headlines, but you want users to editorialize  the 140 character twitter posts. That defeats the purpose of twitter, as a platform.

 Please could you add a crime flair. We get quite a few of those posts, and one for the counselling needed type relationship posts.

How do you define low-effort political self posts? Also what about low-effort political comments in political posts? Can you guys have the automod say which words are censored from the sub so that when my comments get deleted I can remove the offensive words? Thx Mods can you bring back the weekly movies thread

They were being done earlier but then were disbanded dues to lack of popularity after some time

Now with the whole make /r/india better thing going on

I think it would be good time to bring them back, and see how they work now

Plus it would also increase semi-Original Content and NP posts

Maybe stickie those threads early on Whenever we have one of these posts, it is followed by another list of new rules. Can we just let things be for a while?  Please bring up new ways to help new redditers  [deleted] IMHO, you guys need to cut down on your stupid rules, instead of making shitty new ones. 

You guys remind me of the following story:

Edit: just saw the comment by the mods regarding signing up. Will modmail.  - Regarding ""no direct submission to images"" for [P] posts, could you please clarify the reasoning behind this idea? Doing away with memes and ""caption this"" makes sense, but why all images? For example, would an image of a politician slapping someone not be relevant content which would not require any further explanation? Additionally, if you do decide to go ahead with it, why just images and not audio/video?

- Could you clarify what a ""low-effort"" political self-post would be? Would all such content need to be backed up by data or are opinion pieces also allowed? If data is to be made mandatory, how would you plan to make sure that the content isn't an op piece with some data just for the sake of sticking to the rules? [deleted] ""Governance"" flair is an interesting idea. Not sure how much traction it will get but it's worth a shot. There is a very urgent need to separate political bullshit and rhetoric from actual impactful decisions that political parties are taking.  I am very against these ideas of writing essay for self posts. I have already expressed my opinion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3d8epc/is_noise_drowning_out_the_signal_in_rindia/ct2to3p):

> and low-effort content is always upvoted to the top

subjective. people upvote what they like

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.
> 
> No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.

it's censorship. mods shouldn't decide what is 'low-effort' and what is not. the members of community should.

and not everyone wants to read a essay about why submitted an image of some tweet. 

>  /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards.

People like it. Let them decide what they want by uproots/downvotes.

 We need more flairs. Arts, Movies, Books, TV, etc etc. 

We need weekly threads for different topics. Can we automate this please?  Be more strict with with titles which are unverified and misleading. I see them not tagged Wrt flairs.

Try and choose a flair which is a unique set with minimal Overlap and a topic obvious from the name.

So for example governance could be policy. Entertainment I think would be too broad.

Sports is a good choice. I think DIY maybe of value. Ask is another option.  Please take care of posts which are low effort under political flair. Don't let them shitpost. For example like today 

Really low effort & shit post

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlxn8/proof_that_rss_is_literally_hitler/

One line statements from Twitter which creates cicrle-jerk

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlo0y/tell_narendramodi_to_remove_his_paramilitary_from/

Rather ask such people to make self posts or wait till any media house writes a full article on this. What is the point in creating multiple threads due to just one comment from any politician?

As we are growing, we are lacking space on the front page, news & politics keep on clogging up that space.

Please don't resent anything & be harsh on these assholes. You have my vote on this.

Please bring more flairs other than AskIndia/HelpIndia like Sports & Entertainment. Please have more weekly threads like those tech threads & also sticky those threads so more people comment. Thanks for taking the initiative, the new flairs sound like a good idea, implementing them, a far bigger proposition, but doable!!    
>Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced         

This needs to be done. I know it is a big task for the mods, but its the need of the hour! You can find people who are actually driven to do this, and if implemented,along with removal of low effort self posts, will be a welcome respite, and greatly improve the quality of political discourse in the sub.    

Again thanks for trying to bring about a change and I wish you guys all the luck to go through with it. you'll need it :) Could we limit the posts with personal questions and rants? They're almost always unverified, troll bait and conform to the subs circlejerks.

I'd love to see more moderation of those posts than deleting ""Chaddis vs AAPtards"" kind of comments. The latter get downvoted pretty often, anyway. Could you post some guidelines about downvoting that people will see more prominently when they are about to downvote?

Right now whenever someone sees something they don't agree with, it is downvoted to oblivion and it fosters a kind of circlejerk where you only see the majority opinion and anything that disagrees just disappears.

Other options might include keeping the threads in contest mode for a longer time. I used to avoid /r/India like the plague, but now I'm starting to see a lot of intriguing discussions. I still disagree with some people, but we are able to discuss in a logical and informed manner, as opposed to the childish, irrational, and chauvinist way people were a while back.

Re-subscribed. 1. Strictly objective rules. Remove all subjective interpretation from rules. This continues the situation of ""we have fallen short"" remark. When there is no objectivity, two people can have a different opinion about the same comment, and then a rule ceases to be a rule and becomes an opinion. 
2. Self posts for images. Well, there is already a work-around and loophole in current rules where users can post a collage of more than one twitter screenshot and not use exact title rule. Self post provides an easier editorializing of the title. Exactly how will this help reducing shitpost is unclear to me. 
3. New common account that is purely for communication. Does this mean you are now willing to discuss controversial mod decisions in public? This will help the community to understand the thought that went behind deleting some comment or thread and what was the subjective reasoning used? Unless subjective decisions are discussed and debated, these rules are just anchors of imposing your opinion on mod activities. Any comment can be constructed to violate any random rule because ""I felt so"" without any accountability to the community! Modmail is just a safety net because you are afraid that you may have been wrong and 15 people collectively pouncing on one person is better that 300+ people pouncing on the mods for a wrong decision.  Media,Random,Other.


I guess these will be cool flairs. [deleted] Good points...personally, am in complete agreement  *AskIndia*   *Governance*  what do this flairs even mean? 

And how am I suppose to make a self post on a meme in NP category? Defeats the purpose of Memes doesn't it? Thought this place would be more open and free. Definitely need a Political sub and also rules 'only where needed'.  [deleted] >Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Who is going to decide this ?
As it is, there is already too much censorship in a so called platform for free speech. Request:Can politics/religion related posts (I put those two because they are closely linked) be moved to /r/IndiaPolitics or /r/IndianPolitics or whatever that sub is? Would be nice to have more music related posts. Especially folk music from different parts of the country. Please ban twitter and facebook from unverified accounts altogether. Even the ""screenshot+blur"" thing is ridiculous. Self posts with an actual argument that quotes statements from known but unverified officials (i.e. legit public figures who don't have the mark of verification) should be allowed. >Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

And yet you have trolls calling the PM a faggot. How about a [Health] or [Medicine] flair as well? Indians can do with some evidence based medicine. > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.   

I agree with twitter restriction and most of twitter posts are again self-posts without any explanation behind them^Swamy. But, memes keeps the sub interesting. Some of the memes are shit, but I have seen some amusing ones that are randian's creativity.

AskIndia,[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!"," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India. It's just 24 minutes(skip the first 2 minutes of intro) and really goes into depth, yet in an accessible way.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.  ",2017-04-22 17:49:09

There are several alternatives to it, some are linked in that video itself.

Fpps is considered to be one of the worst system of elections and you can trace many of our problems to it. 

Edit: some of the alternatives are alternate vote and single transferable vote.  Fpps is the system in which the candidate with the most number of votes wins, regardless of the number of votes. 
For eg, there are 9 candidates in an election. One gets 12% and each of the others get 11%. The one with 12%will win the election since he has the highest number of votes despite his share being very low. 

This was the system followed in Britain at the time of Indian independence. That and the simplicity of the system led the makers of the Constitution to adopt it.

Getting the two obvious ones out of the way


Anupam Kher,BJP: husband of a BJP politician Kiron kher and has vehemently defended BJP idealogy publically 


Arnab Goswami,BJP: Runs a news channel Repulic TV in partnership with BJP MP. TV Debate on the channel target other parties excessively"," Anupam Kher  - wife supporter like every man should be. ;-) Vishal Dadlani AAP Radhika Roy founder of NDTV is sister of Brinda Karat, MP from CPI(M).

Subash Chandra founder of Essel group which includes Zee News, is a MP from Haryana with support from BJP in Rajya sabha. I respect people like Kher more than Amitabh Bachchan, at least we know where their loyalty lies.

Amitabh has been a Cong MP in 80s.

Then was close to Amar Singh and SP in later 90s and early 200s. Wife is still SP MP.

Became close to Modi when he started to rise.

Now hearing he's going back to cong as we speak.

 Ambani bhool gaye Sudhir Chaudhary - Zee TV. Prakash Raj - Congress  Prannoy Roy, Barkha Dutt, Rajdeep Sardesai and Sagarika Ghose - all Congress  i have been curious about this. most americans openly identify with one of the two (mostly) political parties... i wonder if it means that they are officially a member of that party or they just prefer them over others... it would have been nice if this was the case here as well. would have been easier to decide who to avoid and who not to looking at how things are here in this country.  Many people on here seem to misunderstand the word ""bias"". Opposing a current govt is *not* bias. Refusing to sing praises of the present govt is *not* bias. Bringing to attention where a govt has fallen short is *not* bias.

In fact, it's the job of the media to keep the ruling party in check. To remind the public that all is not well. To maintain transparency. To expose the liars.

Things that *do* constitute bias: false equivalency, what-aboutery, lying to the audience (whether outright or by omission).

Also, people are allowed to have opinions. Vishal Dadlani is not someone who needs to be neutral; he's not a public servant or a newsman. The question of bias is not relevant here at all. Randeep Hooda, Virender Sehwag - BJP Me What is this for? End purpose? Mohandas Pai, former CFO of Infosys is a rabid BJP supporter, just like most bigots in India. A-grade hypocrite too. Gautam Gambhir- BJP I only started following politics after the Nuclear Deal, so don't have historical opinions.

Non-Political,[Non-political] A/c train queue system implemented by people on their own,8gwqi3,https://imgur.com/x2S75mL,," Isnt this a given thing at delhi metro stations now? Bas kar pagle,rulayega kya ? [removed] All those people who are amused by it this is what happens when you give them some infrastructure.  

With Air conditioned trains the doors are closed and open only when the train actually stops.  So you have to wait anyway. 

With other locals I have seen even auntys  board the train before it actually stops so that they can grab a seat.  No way they will wait for the train to stop because some other aunty would have grabbed the seat by then. 

Now if you really want to ensure people queue up start installing platform screening doors.  But that's expensive and I don't have any expectations from Indian railways.   Fake fake fake! OP paid the people to stand in a line! Only if this was followed for every other train too, every morning is a fight to get into a Churchgate bound train Wtf is happening? In which alternate universe is this borivali station located? Propaganda. Next thing you know they will tell that first people will be allowed to get off the train and then people will board the train. Nonsense. Wonder how this happened? Was there constant messaging to nudge people to do this? How did you manage to travel to a parallel universe? History time. When I was growing up in Mumbai in  late '80s every bus stop south of Sion used to have an orderly line to board the bus. It was very similar to this [video](https://youtu.be/ats8Y1yzgPI?t=182). Somehow the suburbs were always unruly. 

Cars waiting at red light was also very common and so was crossing street only when walk signal was on.

But there was always mad rush to board the trains. This is very refreshing.

 Queue!? ab ye kaunsi nayi western concept laye ho?

Hamare sanskriti mai koi queue nahi hota.Kabhi sunna hai pushpak viman mai chadte waqt log queue mai kadhe the?  If I were first in line, I'd just be terrified that the entire line will push forward at anytime even before the train arrives.  I recently made a trip to europe and I was amused to see how the locals were civil to other people. If there's something that Indians need to badly improve - its being civil to others. That huge fan though. People of Mumbai always surprise. The roads are crowded but flow is always smooth Its because its an A/C TRAIN. CIVILISED PEOPLE USE IT. JUST SAYIN  Yay, Mumbai! But there should be markers so that people can queue up on either side of the door and let people alight properly first. After looking this picture I am crying from inside.  Wait there are AC trains on the local lines? I catch a train from andheri in the evening everyday and this is a common sight only in the women's compartment though.. great to watch.

Also, andheri station is jam-packed in the morning and people had to literally fight for climbing up. The last two months have seen a major change and Now everyone stands in a proper queue Wow, this is the India I want to see.  Haath pe chapti maar re. Oh wait...... that's central line. Don't know when central line will become decent. Good to see some positive story since  ages This can only happen in non-rush hours in Mumbai Locals. 

If people start queuing at rush hour the line will stretch for 2 kms outside the station.  Aaja Bhai Tu Bhi Line Mein This is a very interesting experiment in Indian behaviour.

1. If you somehow project the idea of discipline onto people, 95% of them will follow. 50% of these will be rowdy and lawless while taking a local train but will suddenly stand in line because there's a line expected or being formed in front of them in the metro [I've seen this happen IRL].

 And while the line collapses pretty soon, it is still an attempt at order which partially succeeds in two ways - people can alight without battling through a wave of incoming bodies, and folks who are right in the front of these lines get assured seating/standing of their choice.

2. You will see people blatantly flouting rules, throwing their garbage on the floor etc. on normal train platforms. But our metro stations? They're some of the cleanest places in India. Just look at the difference in India's metros - be it Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai... The cities is filthy, the metro system is clean as a whistle.

3. The security system works. Not for its intended role, but it keeps loose food and drink outside the metro system.

I believe civic planners and govt officials can learn some lessons here. *Rechecks*
Am I on the right sub reddit ? 
*Rechecks* There is hope for the country. Demonitization actually had a few benefits!!! Next thing you know people will stop littering.  Then when the streets are clean the cops will stop beating and extorting street vendors and the poor.  Then that will have a snowball effect, and the road workers will start repairing roads with enthusiasm.  Traffic will move smoother and people will be in a better mood, they'll stop going out at night to rape innocent women and children.

Finally, the politicians will see all this and ask for 2% less bribe. This works only until the train arrives. Then it's a free for all. Nice quality! Which camera? Which station? And then there's that one mandatory asshole who decides to jump the queue and plunges everyone into the usual state of chaos. This is how anarcho syndaclisim works people  [deleted] Mumbai Meri jaan unreal
 Is this a Photoshoped image ? I honestly find it had to believe but if true. Wow the wonders!  This is so nice.
 That's very Non-Characteristically Indian Same thing I saw in Mumbai a few days ago. Glad finally people are adopting this. /u/DNA007 :) Wow! Welcome to New India.  Cleverest people , if all mumbai and suburban trains do this , half the problems will be solved . nice post Kaun hai yeh log, kahan se aatey hain ye log? This is common in mumbai at bus stops. In fact no where in India do people 'follow traffic rules' as much as mumbai in my experience.  What alternate universe is this? Sandwich massage for free I can confirm that this happens in the gold class of dubai metro whereas as in normal compartments people just rush in and out like in india They do this in nyc too........  Security staff in Bengaluru metro makes people queue up like this. All of that vanishes once the train arrives lmao Yeh kabse hone laga yaha??? 😯😯  Nice editzz Queing for reserved ticket isn't a big deal. But for local it is. It is impossible . looks like they renovated borivali When people start building a whole railway station on their own without any corporation help, I'm not amused when they start standing in queues.

Back in 1990, while being transferred to the spot where it currently stands, the statue slipped and fell into the water body. Taking the lives of 10 people in the accident. The statue remained under water for 2 years before it was pulled back and erected to where we now see it. Year by year dumping Ganesh idols has made this into a garbage lake.

(non-political)",8ius6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ius6e/rant_do_we_deserve_what_we_have_or_do_we_have/,"Ok, so my classmate from school got a new Mercedes S class. She or her parents didn't buy it, her fiancé gifted it to her. **What does he do?** He acted in a flop movie, his dad owns businesses. **What does she do?** She is jobless since her graduation. Her dad is a lawyer I think, (not sure). But I wouldn't say her family income is significantly greater than mine. For all I know, it might be lesser. At every point in time, I worked my ass off. She, not so much. She's got some rich dude now, and suddenly her life has upgraded a million times.

After a very ugly breakup 4-5 years ago, I extremely hated every female on the planet. It took me months to come out of such unreasoned hatred. But this is the 3rd time one of my childhood friends is marrying a rich dude. I know it is not wrong, but it totally kills off any motivation for doing better in life. This unfair advantage girls have over guys is reinforcing my reasons to hate girls.

I know not all girls are like that. My ex bought a Honda Amaze on her own, by working her ass off and paying EMIs. My friend from university bought a Tesla. But every day, you hear one of your friends say things about girls which only reinforces the belief that girls are gold-diggers. Are they really that pretty? some are but not all. But despite working so hard in almost every aspect of life, a girl from next bench who hasn't worked at all is getting everything I desired. Then why did I work hard? Why should I from now on? What can I say, I'll marry a girl and would be able to afford a vada-pav may be?"," There are guys who marry for job/wealth and stuff as well. Life is unfair if you compare yourself with others. You gotta do what you gotta do. Idk who even told you life is fair. Hardwork leads to success. But hard work isn't the only way to success.

You're totally disregarding the fact that guys get dowry. My neighbor works at a bank as a Junior Officer on Contract. He gets 20k per month and his job isn't even permanent. But he lives in a house that costs a crore and a half, drives a car that costs close to a crore and has a bike that costs 20 lakhs!

And he's not an outlier, the dowry given over here are huge and its there everywhere. My mother's friends boast off about how their son got acres of land , houses and expensive watches in dowry. All their sons are average engineering folks from a tier 3 college working for an IT company. :3 Bhai do you have any idea how much guys get in dowry? Their whole life revolves around getting a good job so their family can extort good dowry from girl's family. They get inherited bunglows, cars, fridge, TV, washing machine, expensive gifts etc you name it, and this is out of compulsion. What your friend got was a gift, she didn't ask for it. This way, men are bigger gold diggers. Stop acting like the world owes you anything. Life isn't supposed to be served on a silver platter. You're making excuses for your own incompetence. Life is unfair, dude. That's the simplest way to look at it. I feel like you quite a lot, but then what makes me stop thinking this way is when I see daily wage laborers or these people who do odd jobs, no matter how hard they work, they will never have a comfortable life. I start to think, how would they feel when they look at us.

I'm not undermining what you are feeling by saying the last thing. Like I said, I feel the same way, but yeah. Life is unfair. Hi.

I feel you.

I really do.
An ex of mine left me for a richer dude. It shattered me to pieces. I was devastated. There was no motivation for a good while. I was cutting myself ( I hate people who do it, it achieves nothing, just like suicide).

I know what you're going through.

I find solace in the fact that no one can point at me and say ' Baap ka paisa'. 

I made myself. You'll too. 

Men want just one thing dude. And that one thing is disgusting. Men just want Man Samman.

Its all that will ever matter.

I hope this helped. Life is different for everybody and in every aspect. Why wasting time and mindfulness on comparing yourself to someone else. What do you want? What will you have to do to achieve it? Fuck rest of the world and work on that.

And yes, please change the scale which you use to measure happiness. A Mercedes is happiness for 2 days. Inner satisfaction is the key. Get their. Life doesn’t owe you anything. Life doesn’t have to be fair, life doesn’t have to be unfair. It is what it is. There is no logic or rewards systems with life. Sometimes you get what you deserve and other times you don’t, this can either be good or bad. 

All you can do is, put in your best and hope you don’t get a hot pile of shit in return. C’est la vie. ",2018-05-12 22:02:19

Ban Whatsapp forwarding of a message which has been already forwarded by 'n' people unless it is inspected by the company/police to be not fake news or not an attempt of instigating the mob (This will be easy to implement as people never edit the message and just keep forwarding it.)

2. If possible ban the internet for 'uneducated' (debatable) people and only allow them internet when they are properly educated about the norms and ethics of being on internet (Why not under a national program like Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas; This type of **""Vikas""** is in dire need)"," > Ban Whatsapp forwarding of a message

Thats such an Indian way to deal with anything, end all solution - ban, though it may not be effective.

> which has been already forwarded by 'n' people unless it is inspected by the company/police to be not fake news or not an attempt of instigating the mob

This would also require Whatsapp, the organization to track each and every message being shared on their app. At the moment, it has end-to-end encryption.

> If possible ban the internet for 'uneducated' (debatable) people

Who is going to implement such bizarre solution on the ground.

Will the government come up with public-private participation issues licenses for internet fitness test?

No way people are tall as that in India. Sad that this data is bullshite of the highest order. Woooo, I'm on a list.  [deleted] I spent 2 hours to make this dashboard using **Tableau Public** software. I, unfortunately, do not have any knowledge on data parsing and had to resort the *sarkaari daftar* way of filling up an Excel sheet manually. You can interact with the dashboard by clicking on any State on the map and will get a result at the bottom of where you stand compared to other Redditors from the same state. You can also hover over a State to summarize the results of the survey.
For the interactive dashboard, please follow the link below- [Interactive Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/shantanu.mendhekar#!/vizhome/HowtallarerIndians/Dashboard)

If you are interested in knowing how the dashboard works, or want me to make more such dashboards then let's work something out! Appreciate the job you have done OP. Irrespective of the veracity of the data, everyone from r/india is appreciative of the effort you have put forward in this.

Need a similar thread to collect data on dick and tit size of randians with proof ofc. Nice job OP but 100 isn't a good enough number to get a proper sample. Most people with average or below average height aren't likely to say it, so the average isn't necessarily an 'average'. Just wanted to add that caveat. Nice job otherwise!  How did you know my state? Garbage in garbage out. Iam a midget in my own country 😢 Jesus.... This wasn't about penile length. No need to lie for this one. The problem is most people overestimate their height. It's a common phenomenon. Most of my friends initially would say that they are 5'10 or 6 feet but they were quite shocked when actual measurement (using a stadiometer) showed that they overestimated their height by 2-3 inches their entire lives. Using a measuring tape to measure height might be prone to errors unless you are making sure that the tape is exactly perpendicular to ground. Even a slight difference in degree of inclination would result in overestimation by 1-2 inches. Therefore my tip would be to actually get measured guys. You'll be shocked !! [deleted] [deleted] Thank you for the overwhelming response, guys.

To reply to all of you -
1. The sample size is, of course, minuscule compared to our overall population of 1.3 Billion people. Actually it is just 0.0000001% of the entire population. So take the visualization with a *chutki bhar namak*.

2. The thread from which this data off of was not a proper survey. So, if you all are interested in a such visualizations, we can have short surveys using Google Forms.

3. I will be making more of such visualizations, since we don't have a dearth of data regarding India. You can check our own initiative here- [Data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/)

4. The data visualization software that I have used is Tableau Public, where you can visualize any data the way you want for FREE.

You can also find training videos and start learning Tableau right away here- [Tableau Training Videos](http://www.tableau.com/learn/training) I'm pretty sure I can headbutt /u/Starkboy in the nuts. What da hell!! So many comments at 0?

Someone/people are sure salty.. Which state did you put me in? I never told you my state bro gays and grills combined???? No way 6.2 is the avg height in Kerala. I'm 5.10 and I feel tall when in a bus in Kerala. There are a lot of people that are taller than 6, but it is no way the avg 6'4"" in Jharkhand? I have to see that Now we are done with heights how about we compare penis size now? Some serious errors in the calculations. For ex: average of Telangana is around 6 ft 1.5 in (5'9"", 6'1"", 6'2"", 6'6"") but is shown as 6'5"".  Let's conduct it again seriously! Also using metric please. It gives more accurate values. I see a nice gaussian distribution :) You aren't supposed to measure along the rice belly, people! Again, last on the list.

Non-Political,[Non-Political][Serious]: What's your thoughts on GST now?,6izxwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6izxwj/nonpoliticalserious_whats_your_thoughts_on_gst_now/,"1st of all; I'm not looking for political circle-jerking. I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I’m wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn’t solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn’t pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It’s far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. “Given the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.
"," I actually welcome the One Nation; One Tax system. But with GST, this primary objective is defeated when we have multiple tax rates. But there is hope the rates will be made homogeneous over a period of time.

GST is taunted  as a measure to reduce the paper work and complexity of businesses. But the government failed to address where WE the consumers are in the equation. It was advocated that the less procedures and simplicity in tax returns would increase the efficiency and would result in reduction of cost which will ultimately benefit the consumers.
However, with the raise of key services like banking, insurance, etc from the existing 15% service tax to 18% GST, the consumer interest takes back seat. For service industry I believe they should have atleast kept in a similar rates since there is no visible benefit when you are going to higher tax for the same shitty services.

The governments preparedness with systems is questionable since there were reports that the implementation dates should be postponed due to this. But the government is firm on implementing from July 1st, as with demonetization they are not bothered with the consequences. But this will ultimately affect the businesses and result in lower growth.

As you mentioned, registration with multiple states and filing returns would defeat the primary purpose of GST. Also for inter-state transactions, the government advised the business to continue using the existing forms, so the state border checkposts will remain.

Yes in longer run probably 3 - 5 years the system will mature and we may even have one single rate for all commodities in the future.

  To tell you the truth OP I still don't understand what the GST does . I mean I get the gist of it like all indirect taxes will be abolished , different tax rates by different states will now be the same but other than it I still don't know what it is going to do I think a lot of us cheered its passage, but in hindsight, I really think the BJP should have waited until securing its own majority in the Rajya Sabha instead. As you, OP, point out, they ended up having to make too many mini concessions to get everyone on board, and the effect was just replacing 28 different complicated, bureaucratic AF tax systems to one big one. 

But it's a step in the right direction. In hindsight a lot of Modi bhakts (myself included) naively supposed this was going to be a quick shot, overnight process - I think successive governments will keep tweaking it. Hopefully. Why would inflation rise? [deleted]",2017-06-23 22:02:19
Non-Political,[Non-Political] Ola Cabs in Bangalore,4445au,http://imgur.com/WlZaVSy,," And when you confirm your ride, some driver from 2km away will come to pick you up. Wonder how many of them on the map are fake. Aahh.. An urban-dweller's dream come true They are having an n-some That is some really shitty experience.

Even though you have a 100 cars, just keep a limit on how many cars you want to show on the app.

Expectation Setting : The road is literally filled with cabs. You will get one in like a minute or so. 
Result : Still get a cab that is 2 kms away or more than 10 mins away. Well that's just the weekly ola orgy being carried out in peace Bangalore is the only major city in the country where you can  park pretty much where you want.  I don't think I've ever seen cars being towed or asked to move off any road here.   Just curious, what is that place on the right where they have a shitload of cabs? I used to live in that neighbourhood 4 years ago. There were zero normal cabs. The times, they change! Why does it say Indra Nagar near Jakkur? Better than Uber I think, got an Alto 800 today in Uber. I'm 5'9"", my colleagues are 6'2"" and 6'. It felt like solitary confinement in there. [removed] And despite the shit load of cabs present, there is not a single TFS cab.

It's always the case, the 6 Rs/Km cab is a myth. that's what is called a cluster fuck I really, really, really like this image.  You're lucky that a cab is in your area. My area is quite away from the main city and most of the time there are no cabs in the area. One time I had to go to the station and I couldn't find one, Uber saved the day (but with 1.4x price surge). It could be entirely possible that most of them are on their way somewhere else and hence showing on the map?  The Ola Centipede Now I know why traffic is so bad in Bangalore.  Seen something like this on BTM last Saturday morning around 11 AM. It was still 1.5 times, waited for some more time it became 1.3. Then i saw TFS car and booked it immediately without any surge pricing. 

I use OLA a lot, have been to cars couple of times when driver said it is their first day in OLA.
